Notebook 1 includes a clear two-panel plot with aligned time axes for stimulus and response, with proper unit conversions and labeling. Notebook 2 plots both the current clamp and voltage clamp sweeps, and uses a twin y-axis approach to overlay the two signals in a single plot, allowing immediate comparison but at some risk of confusion due to dual axes. The addition of voltage clamp plots is an advantage for Notebook 2 as it demonstrates both response modes.",

In Notebook 2, the joining of current and voltage curves on twin axes may be confusing for some readers (especially with large unit differences), but it enables compact comparison. One potential negative is the use of raw units for current (Amperes instead of pA or nA), which could be misleading if not familiar.
