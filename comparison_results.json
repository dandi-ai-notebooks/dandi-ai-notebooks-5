The code is broken into logical sections with explanatory comments throughout, affording users a good starting toolkit for extending or tweaking.\n\nNotebook 2 offers reusable code, especially the general function for extracting traces by sweep/channel, and shows twinx overlays to combine data. However, the plotting examples are limited in type (individual sweeps rather than summary visualizations). Notebook 2 is good, but Notebook 1 demonstrates more plotting variety and thus builds more confidence.",

The current-step trends further highlight protocol design. Notebook 2 gives complementary detail (showing both Vm and stimulus for individual sweeps/channels)\u2014but without \"at a glance\" structure for the entire set.\n\nBoth notebooks show key aspects, but Notebook 1 provides a broader visualization of the dataset structure within a single cell, while Notebook 2 emphasizes per-sweep detail.

While this is useful, overall Notebook 1's modularity and clarity slightly improve reusability for most users.\n\nIf anything, these are quite close; if the scoring system allowed 0.5, one could make a case for it here, but per the rubric, Notebook 1 is preferred.",
