Notebook 1 gives a simple, reusable plot function for a single sweep, while Notebook 2 shows how to plot multiple sweeps and use twin y-axes, as well as handling units and extracting relevant fields from the NWB file. For users wanting to create new or varied visualizations, the approaches in Notebook 2 (looping, labeling, plotting multiple traces, twin axes) provide more robust examples and inspire greater confidence for future custom plots.",
