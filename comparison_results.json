Notebook 1 provides suggested analyses and remarks on the meaning of certain results (e.g. relating dF/F to running, interpreting population response plots). However, its flat-line plot (stimulus-aligned average response) is potentially misleading, which could confuse some users. Notebook 2\u2019s interpretations are more cautious and match the data shown, acknowledging limitations in ROI overlays, for example. On balance, Notebook 2 avoids confusion and unsupported conclusions a bit better.",

Notebook 2, being more concise, is if anything too brief rather than repetitive. The differences are minor.",
