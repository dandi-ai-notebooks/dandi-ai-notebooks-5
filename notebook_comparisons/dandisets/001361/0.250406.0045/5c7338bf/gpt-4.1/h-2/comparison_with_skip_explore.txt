<question_shortened>Understanding Dandiset purpose and content</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 gives a very clear, structured introduction: a prominent title, Dandiset citation, a succinct but informative overview, and a bulleted summary of dataset types. The context ("flexible hippocampal population code for experience...") is well established, and the notebook explicitly states what it will cover. It also highlights the source publication and points users to NWB/dandi ecosystem documentation.
Notebook 2 introduces the dataset effectively too, naming the dataset, summarizing its contents, and describing its purpose (learning reward locations in virtual reality). However, it is slightly less structured and a bit less detailed in the initial overview than Notebook 1 (fewer dataset modalities listed, e.g., doesn't mention ROI/segmentation metadata or explicitly list data branches up front). Both cite the Dandiset and paper, but Notebook 1 is a bit more complete and systematic in communicating data modalities and intended use.

<question_shortened>Confidence accessing different data types</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 systematically demonstrates accessing behavioral (position, speed, licks, rewards), imaging (fluorescence), and segmentation (metadata, masks, and mean/max images) data types. Code is provided to access these modalities, and summaries clarify what is being accessed. Notebook 2 provides clear code for accessing behavioral position, deconvolved neural activity, and segmentation masks for ROIs, but it omits some data streams shown in Notebook 1 (e.g., licks, reward zone, speed, mean/max images, ROI probabilities). Notebook 1 more thoroughly demonstrates access to a diversity of Dandiset data, building stronger confidence in accessing/using multiple modalities.

<question_shortened>Understanding NWB structure and usage</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2 has a section dedicated to listing and printing the file structure using h5py, visually showing all top-level NWB groups/datasets and briefly describing their purpose. This is a didactic demonstration of NWB HDF5 navigation. Notebook 1, in contrast, assumes a bit more NWB familiarity (uses pynwb), and while it lists acquisition and processing modules and inspects a few branches, it doesn't print the overall file structure as clearly.

<question>4</question>
<question_shortened>Quality of visualizations for data understanding</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 includes diverse and informative visualizations: a stacked overview plot for multiple behavioral streams (position, speed, licks, reward zone with reward times marked), calcium imaging traces (10 randomly chosen cells, offset), a histogram of ROI probability, and mean/max imaging frames. These plots are well labeled, have reasonable axes, and offer deep insights into both experiment structure and data quality. Notebook 2 shows three main types of plots: positional trajectory (full session), spike-like neural activity for 10 cells (offset), and ROI scatter plots (segmentation masks in pixel space). Its visualizations are also clear and labeled, but less multifaceted: it shows fewer behavioral variables and lacks built-in interpretive overlays (e.g., reward events). Overall, Notebook 1 provides a richer, more informative set of visualizations.

<question>5</question>
<question_shortened>Any confusing or misleading visualizations?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook presents actively misleading or confusing visualizations. In Notebook 2, the mouse position plot for the full session could be a bit overwhelming for new users (many ramps/laps in a long continuous trace), but the axis labeling and legend are clear, and guidance is provided. Notebook 1’s behavioral overview is well structured for short-term viewing, and axes/legends are clear on all plots. All visualizations are well formatted and clear in both, with minor improvements possible (notebook 2 could mask negative/artifact values or add overlays, but does flag this in text).

<question>6</question>
<question_shortened>Confidence to create own visualizations</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks provide well-commented, modular code for making various plots; both access NWB/HDF5 structures directly or via pynwb and use matplotlib for customization. However, Notebook 1 offers a greater diversity of behavioral and imaging data plots, histogramming, and image display, and provides interpretive guidance for overlaying behavioral events (reward). This equips users slightly better to extend/adapt code for their own custom analyses.

<question>7</question>
<question_shortened>Visualizing structure/complexity of data</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 visualizes the complexity of the data by showing multi-modal structure: behavioral traces, reward overlays, calcium trace population dynamics, distributions of cell likelihoods, and example imaging fields of view. This multi-angle approach helps users grasp experimental richness and heterogeneity. Notebook 2’s focus is more on core components (position, neural activity, ROI spatial masks), but does not show the full structure of all behavioral variables, event data, or ROI statistics. For complexity/structure, Notebook 1 sets a higher standard.

<question>8</question>
<question_shortened>Interpretations or conclusions unclear/unjustified?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks stick to descriptive interpretations, avoiding overreaching or misleading claims. Notebook 1 gives concise written interpretations under each plot (e.g., how reward events align to behavior or how the calcium signals appear), all well-supported by the presented data. Notebook 2 offers brief but accurate commentaries after each main plot. No interpretations in either notebook feel unclear or unsupported; both are careful and reserved in claims.

<question>9</question>
<question_shortened>Unnecessarily repetitive or redundant plots/examples?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook is overtly repetitive. Notebook 1 covers similar themes (behavior, neural, segmentation), but each plot explores a distinct dimension. Notebook 2 likewise does not repeat examples, though its coverage is somewhat more limited in scope (but not redundant). No unnecessary repetition is present in either.

<question>10</question>
<question_shortened>Help understanding potential next analyses</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 provides a “Summary and Next Steps” section with explicit prompts about follow-on analyses (population codes, linking cells to behavior, event-triggered averaging) and even links to original analysis code. Throughout, its comments and structure suggest avenues for further work (adapting the plots for other behavioral correlates, ROI analysis, etc). Notebook 2 provides a “What’s Next?” summary encouraging exploration of additional variables, neural signals, and trialwise analyses, though with fewer specific suggestions. It suggests consulting documentation and the paper for more.
Overall, Notebook 1 does a better job *within the notebook itself* at connecting the core demo to new analysis ideas and providing practical next steps.

<question_shortened>Clarity and ease of following notebook</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks are well-organized and readable. Notebook 1 is notable for its explicit sectioning, clear markdown titles, and sequential building of complexity. Notebook 2 is also logical and stepwise but a bit briefer in some commentary and explanations; some users might prefer its conciseness, but it may leave more gaps for a novice. Both feature comments and inline rationales. Overall, both are clear, but Notebook 1’s higher degree of pedagogical structure gives it a small edge.

<question>12</question>
<question_shortened>Reusable/adaptable code for exploration</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks provide reusable code; Notebook 2’s code is perhaps a little more “bare-metal” (HDF5 path navigation) while Notebook 1 uses pynwb and higher-level NWB semantics, including robust field extraction and safety checks (e.g., dealing with possible missing rates/timestamps). Notebook 1 presents more code pathways for behavioral, imaging, and segmentation data and is annotated for extension/adaptation. Both are solid, but Notebook 1 is more modular and thus slightly more reusable.

<question>13</question>
<question_shortened>Understanding further questions/analyses</question_shortened>
<rationale>
This is similar to question 10, but focusing on how well the notebook points users toward specific scientific/analytic questions (not just general “explore more!”). Notebook 1’s suggestions (“identifying place cells, event-triggered averaging, etc.”) plus its link to the analysis code repository provide more concrete brainstorming. Notebook 2 discusses further exploration as “templates to plot or analyze other variables/neural signals” and encourages consulting documentation, but is less detailed. Notebook 1 is better at seeding scientific creativity for reanalysis.

<question_shortened>Overall helpfulness for getting started</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 stands out as a more comprehensive, pedagogically structured, and versatile resource for getting started with Dandiset 001361. It covers a broader diversity of data modalities, offers richer and more interpretive visualizations, directly supports next-step reanalysis, and points to further resources. Notebook 2 is clear, concise, and good for focused technical orientation (especially for users wanting a quick HDF5 structure overview), but feels slightly less supportive for scientific newcomers or for motivating investigative directions.
