<question>1</question>
<question_shortened>Understanding the Dandiset purpose/content</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks introduce the Dandiset with a summary of the scientific context, describing the use of 2-photon calcium imaging to study population coding related to reward. Notebook 2 offers more structured, detailed metadata (species, number of mice, number/size of files, task description), which helps to orient the user to the scope and variety of the dataset, while Notebook 1 is more succinct, focusing mainly on the analysis steps. The second notebook's extended "Overview" and explicit dataset features provide a richer backdrop for understanding both scientific and data aspects of the Dandiset.

<question_shortened>Confidence in accessing different data types</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks show how to access NWB files and data elements. Notebook 2 goes further by listing all NWB files, presenting a summary table of available files with sizes, and giving a clear strategy for selecting sessions. This extra context, as well as the explicit demonstration of behavioral and imaging data access, gives the user more confidence in exploring the dataset comprehensively, not just a "single file for demonstration."

<question>3</question>
<question_shortened>Understanding NWB file structure and how to work with it</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2 gives a more explicit walkthrough of the NWB file structure, including loading metadata (subject info, session info), accessing multiple types of behavioral time series, and extracting the shape and number of imaging traces/ROIs. Notebook 1 accesses behavioral and neural data but gives less structural context (for example, it doesn't display overall NWB metadata or enumerate available time series). The structured exploration in Notebook 2 helps users map file contents to conceptual organization.

<question>4</question>
<question_shortened>Helpfulness of visualizations for key data aspects</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2's behavioral visualization breaks out five simultaneous time series (position, licking, reward zone, trial number, speed) in a clear vertically stacked figure, directly reflecting the behavioral richness. It also visually compares both raw and deconvolved calcium traces for multiple cells. Notebook 1 combines position, speed, and reward plots (still clear), and shows fluorescence traces for several ROIs, but does not show deconvolved traces. Both make the neural data accessible, but Notebook 2’s multi-series behavioral panel and comparison of trace types are particularly instructive.

<question>5</question>
<question_shortened>Did any visualizations hinder understanding?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks use generally clear, standard visualizations. Notebook 1’s "cell probability" histogram may be unclear for novices who do not understand iscell data, and the offset stacking in calcium traces is not explained. Notebook 2’s stacked behavioral panel is clear, axes and labels are adequate, and the trace comparison is visually informative. Notably, Notebook 2 provides clearer axis labeling overall. No visualizations in either notebook mislead the reader, but Notebook 2’s formatting is marginally more polished.

<question_shortened>Confidence in creating own visualizations</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks provide code for importing, extracting, plotting, and formatting diverse data types. Notebook 2 highlights an approach to handling multiple time series, use of Pandas for file summary, and raw vs. deconvolved neural data visualization. These techniques, plus better axis labeling and subplot organization, provide a more transferable visualization template, making the user more confident in expanding on the examples.

<question>7</question>
<question_shortened>Visualizations show structure/complexity of data</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2 provides a broader multidimensional view of the data: it includes summary statistics for all files (scope of experiment), shows trial-wise behavioral organization, and exposes both raw and processed neural activity. Notebook 1 visualizes position, speed, reward, fluorescence, and peri-reward responses, but less systematically explores behavioral richness or multi-session complexity. Thus, Notebook 2 better visualizes both breadth (dataset scope) and depth (trial structure, processing steps).

<question>8</question>
<question_shortened>Clarity/soundness of interpretations or conclusions</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks are cautious, mostly sticking to “demonstrate how to load/analyze/visualize,” and avoid over-interpreting results. Notebook 1 takes a minor step further by plotting peri-reward neural activity and suggesting interpretation (reward alignment). Both mention next steps as suggestions, not direct conclusions. No major ambiguities arise, although Notebook 1’s histogram might benefit from explaining biological significance of the metric. Overall, both are comparably sound; Notebook 1 is slightly more analytical, but both are exploratory in spirit.

<question>9</question>
<question_shortened>Redundancy/repetitiveness in plots or examples</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook is noticeably redundant or repetitive. Each analytic step and plot serves a clear, distinct purpose. If anything, Notebook 1's peri-reward analysis could be considered an extra exploratory step, but it does not repeat content. Notebook 2 uses non-overlapping behavioral/time series and neural plots. Both maintain a clean progression through their respective workflows.

<question>10</question>
<question_shortened>Did the notebook help you understand questions/analyses you could do next?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks provide a “next steps” or “potential analyses” ending section with sensible ideas (e.g., align neural activity to behavioral events, study place coding, explore learning). Notebook 2 specifies more analytical directions and points to resources (e.g., paper code, NWB browser), which specifically increase the reader’s awareness of what’s possible. Notebook 1 focuses more on sequence and reward, while Notebook 2 points to field mapping, population dynamics, and analysis resources, making future research directions clearer.

<question_shortened>Overall clarity/ease of following notebook</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks are structured with descriptive headers and logically ordered sections. Notebook 2’s use of data summaries, table display, and explicit organization of behavioral and neural data sections, plus thorough labeling and documentation, give it an edge in clarity and navigation. The progress through entire session loading, metadata, time series, and traces is more explicit and less abrupt. Notebook 1 is clear and stepwise but more minimal.

<question>12</question>
<question_shortened>Code reusability/adaptability</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks provide reusable code for core tasks (loading Dandiset via DANDI API, reading NWB remotely, extracting time series, plotting traces). Notebook 2’s demo of enumerating files, creating size tables, and modularized plot code (with variables for subsets/cells/time) would facilitate user adaptation for their own analyses, especially when selecting files or scaling analyses up. Also, involving pandas is useful for summary and organization.

<question>13</question>
<question_shortened>Did the notebook help you understand what kinds of questions or analyses you could do next?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Very similar to Q10, but focusing explicitly on next steps, Notebook 2 gives more substantial guidance (“align neural activity to behavioral events," "map place fields," "study population dynamics," and provides links to analysis code and browser for further exploration). Notebook 1 lists future directions but is less expansive. Thus, Notebook 2 better prepares users conceptually for extending their analyses.

<question>14</question>
<question_shortened>Overall helpfulness for getting started</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2 is more comprehensive: it covers file enumeration, summary statistics, structured metadata introspection, exploration of behavioral and imaging data, more nuanced visualization examples, and offers more specific suggestions for further analyses. It is clearer, more user-friendly, and gives the user a stronger foundation for getting started with this Dandiset. Notebook 1 is helpful for a basic introduction but lacks the breadth and guidance seen in Notebook 2.
