<question>1</question>
<question_shortened>Understanding purpose and content</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks start with a clear overview describing the scientific objective, experimental manipulation, and core data types. Notebook 1 offers a more narrative style, explicitly stating "In this notebook you will learn:" and breaking down the dataset's scientific rationale and content. Notebook 2 is concise, slightly less narrative, but highlights the same experimental context. Both clarify that the data is in NWB and involves virtual navigation with DREADDs. However, Notebook 1’s bulleted summary and explicit statements about learning goals make it slightly more accessible for a new user.

<question>2</question>
<question_shortened>Confidence in accessing data types</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks explicitly show how to connect to DANDI, list available files, and access NWB file assets for streaming. Both highlight use of DANDI API, remfile, and pynwb. The detail is comparable, but Notebook 1 more clearly steps through the process for selecting a file and mentions what each code block is doing. Notebook 2 also provides direct code and even prints file sizes, which is practical. Overall, both provide solid, practical guidance, with only minor differences in approach.

<question>3</question>
<question_shortened>Understanding NWB structure</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks offer good NWB structure intros: accessing session metadata, electrodes, units, and trials, and converting tables to DataFrames. Notebook 2 explicitly previews the content of the units/trials tables and comments on the usage of dynamic spike_times per row, which is a subtle but valuable pointer. Notebook 1 is solid, though a little less explicit about NWB table peculiarities.

<question>4</question>
<question_shortened>Visualizations aid understanding</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks offer a similar set of visualizations: trial durations, spike counts/unit, raster plots, raw voltage traces, and electrode group distributions. Notebook 2 adds a trial-aligned raster plot (peri-event raster for first unit), illustrating a slightly more advanced and practically critical figure for analysis pipelines. Notebook 1’s figures are clear but stop at basic epoched visualizations. Thus, Notebook 2 edges ahead for including a pivotal peri-event alignment visual.

<question>5</question>
<question_shortened>Any problematic visualizations?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
All core visualizations in both notebooks are reasonable, with clear labels and axes. Neither notebook introduces misleading or poorly formatted plots. One minor note is that in both, all channels are labeled ‘unknown’ for location, but this reflects dataset metadata rather than visualization design. Some color legends overlap with data in both cases, but to the same degree. No plot stands out as actively leading to misunderstanding.

<question>6</question>
<question_shortened>Confidence creating own visualizations</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2 offers slightly more variety, especially with its trial-aligned raster section, demonstrating a real-world technique for perievent analysis. Both show straightforward matplotlib code for plotting histograms, rasters, and line traces. Either would give a user a template for extension, but Notebook 2 “primes” a user more for event-locked approaches commonly needed in systems neuroscience.

<question>7</question>
<question_shortened>Visualizations of data structure/complexity</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks visualize spike count per unit and trial duration distributions (showing variability). Both show multi-channel raw voltage snippets (though with slightly different offsets/unit conventions). Both plot electrode group barplots, but with similar lack of anatomical detail (due to metadata). The peri-event raster in Notebook 2 is uniquely valuable for showing trial-locked response complexity. In general, both show “richness” clearly, but Notebook 2 takes it a step further.

<question>8</question>
<question_shortened>Clarity/support of interpretations/conclusions</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook makes strong scientific interpretations—both keep to descriptive summaries (counts, distributions, visual previews) and encourage further analysis. Notebook 2 refers to what visualizations “demonstrate,” but this is factual (e.g., distribution of trial durations). There are no unsupported analytical leaps, and all figures shown are well connected to the printed metadata/tables.

<question>9</question>
<question_shortened>Repetition or redundancy in plots/examples</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook is notably redundant. Some visualizations overlap between the two (unit counts, trial durations), but that is expected for a quickstart exploration. Notebook 2’s extra raster plots add variety rather than redundancy. Overall, neither feels padded or repetitious for its purpose.

<question>10</question>
<question_shortened>Ideas for next steps/analysis</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks have a “next steps” or “suggestions” section at the end, listing possible analyses—spike-to-trial alignment, LFP exploration, etc. Notebook 1 lists these suggestions in bullet form at the close, while Notebook 2 reiterates options within the summary section. Both are effective in pointing users towards further analyses.

<question_shortened>Clarity and ease of following notebook</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 is organized in a structured, stepwise manner with clear section headers and narrative lead-ins. It leads the user from data access, through metadata, to each data modality, then to figures and summary. Notebook 2 is also well-structured, and its numbered sections make navigation explicit; it occasionally assumes more user familiarity (e.g., less breakdown of what you "will learn" before the code). Overall, both are clear, but Notebook 1’s didactic framing may be more beginner-friendly.

<question_shortened>Code reusability/adaptability</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks provide reusable, well-commented code for every major step. Notebook 2 even emphasizes that users can swap out asset paths for alternate files, and its peri-event spike alignment example is a particularly useful snippet to adapt for other datasets. Otherwise, the code in both is modular and accessible for adaptation.

<question_shortened>Overall helpfulness for getting started</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks are excellent for onboarding new users to this Dandiset and the associated analysis pipeline. Notebook 1 is slightly stronger for absolute beginners due to its explicit teaching sections and gentle hand-holding. Notebook 2, however, stands out for including more advanced examples (peri-event raster), slightly more practical code (e.g., sizing files), and commentary about NWB structure/subtleties. For a user wanting to actually start analysis, Notebook 2 is marginally better, though both are very good.
