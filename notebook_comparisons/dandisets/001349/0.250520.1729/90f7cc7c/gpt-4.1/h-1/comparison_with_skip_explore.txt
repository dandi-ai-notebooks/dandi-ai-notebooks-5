<question>1</question>
<question_shortened>Helps understand Dandiset purpose/content?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 begins with a concise but thorough overview, including scientific focus, data modalities, and metadata, emphasizing both the biological question and data structure. It directly frames the Dandiset’s scientific context, developmental window, and available data types. Notebook 2 provides a similar overview, but the opening is a bit sparser, emphasizes key points in bullet form, and focuses slightly more on the technical aspects of what’s included and what the user will learn. Both establish context, but Notebook 1 provides a slightly richer narrative connection to the scientific purpose, especially through prose and explicit context-setting. Therefore, Notebook 1 is more effective in conveying both the intent and scientific scope.

<question>2</question>
<question_shortened>Confident how to access Dandiset data?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks explain how to access NWB files from the Dandiset and use the DANDI API to list and select assets. Notebook 1 steps through the process a bit more verbosely, showing how to connect, list assets, and select a sample asset, providing more explicit information for beginners. Notebook 2 also demonstrates this process, listing 10 assets instead of five, and specifies which asset will be used for the remainder of the notebook. Both serve the purpose well. However, Notebook 1 slightly edges out Notebook 2 in clarity, especially in walking the reader through the steps more gradually and showing clear printouts of intermediate outputs.

<question>3</question>
<question_shortened>Helps understand NWB file structure?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 provides a section titled “Overview of Imaging Data Structure,” detailing the contents of the “ophys” processing module, types of time series, and segmentation organization. This explicit explanation, accompanied by a summary of the various data series and their relationships, gives a strong introduction to how the NWB files are structured. Notebook 2 lists the available time series and explains what is in the “Fluorescence” group, but the overall description of the NWB structure is less systematic and more focused on just listing keys one at a time. Therefore, Notebook 1 clearly does a better job orienting users to NWB file organization and relationships.

<question>4</question>
<question_shortened>Do visualizations help understand data?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 visualizes ΔF/F and raw fluorescence for 5 example ROIs in overlay plots, then provides summary plots of mean ± std, and finally attempts to show several ROI segmentation masks, even if mask info is sparse. The population-averaged statistics and the side-by-side visualization of multiple ROIs allow for a stronger appreciation of heterogeneity and overall signal properties. Notebook 2 focuses exclusively on ROI 0, showing a ΔF/F trace, a raw fluorescence trace, and the ROI 0 mask, with clear but single-cell views. As a result, Notebook 1’s visualizations better convey the range and structure of the data across the population, while Notebook 2 is more limited in scope.

<question>5</question>
<question_shortened>Did any visualizations hinder understanding?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1’s mask plotting code appears to have sometimes produced “No mask” placeholder images, which reduces interpretability for some users and could be confusing at first glance, though the intent is clear. Apart from this, both notebooks have clear axes and labels in time series plots. Notebook 2’s visualizations are crisp and always contain real data (for ROI 0), mitigating the risk of showing confusing empty results. Therefore, Notebook 2 avoids any potential visualization confusion, whereas Notebook 1’s mask visualization, though well intended, could slightly hinder understanding due to “No mask” results.

<question>6</question>
<question_shortened>Confidence to make your own visualizations?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 offers code for plotting multiple ROIs and overlays, summary statistics, error bands, and attempts multi-ROI segmentation visualizations. This diversity in plotting, including handling population statistics, provides useful templates for more advanced future visualizations. Notebook 2, while clear, sticks strictly to single-ROI plots and does not exemplify synthesizing across ROIs, so its adaptability is more limited. Thus, Notebook 1’s breadth and diversity of visualization code are more empowering for building user’s own visualizations.

<question>7</question>
<question_shortened>Visualizations show structure/complexity?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1’s use of overlays (for multiple ROIs), mean ± std population traces, and attempt at showing multiple segmentation masks enables visualization of variability across cells, temporal variation, and aspects of spatial structure (albeit hampered by missing mask data). Notebook 2 is restricted to a single ROI at a time, so the complexity and heterogeneity present in the data (across ROIs or in the population statistics) are largely hidden. Thus, Notebook 1 paints a richer, more informative picture of the dataset’s structure and complexity.

<question>8</question>
<question_shortened>Unclear/unsupported interpretations?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook makes strong scientific claims or overt interpretations beyond stating what is plotted. Explanations remain descriptive and at the level of “sanity check” or basic exploration. Occasionally, Notebook 1 offers a bit more narrative in connecting code to data structure or possible usage (e.g., recommended next steps). Neither presents questionable or unsupported interpretations. The only minor difference is Notebook 1’s “sanity check” phrasing, which is not misleading. Thus, their clarity in interpretation is effectively equal.

<question>9</question>
<question_shortened>Any redundant plots/examples?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks plot ΔF/F and raw fluorescence for the same ROI(s), which is reasonable and instructive. Notebook 1 adds a population (mean ± std) view, which is complementary, and attempts multi-ROI mask plotting. No section feels unnecessarily repetitive; each visualization serves to illustrate a different aspect of the data. Notebook 2 remains succinct with no redundancy. So, while Notebook 1 includes more plots, this is additive rather than redundant—their scope is justified.

<question_shortened>Helps with next steps/future analyses?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 ends with a “Next Steps and Further Analysis” section that explicitly suggests future directions, like cell-cell correlation, event detection, and behavioral alignment, and notes where to find further documentation and guidance. Notebook 2’s closing section is more of a recap of what was done, reminding the user to consult documentation, but does not actively propose future analytic ideas. Thus, Notebook 1 better primes users for how to build upon what was shown.

<question_shortened>Clarity/ease of following notebook?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks are well-commented and reasonably easy to follow, including logical headers and inline explanations for each step. Notebook 1 sometimes provides more context before steps, which can be helpful for those less familiar with the data, but is a bit more verbose. Notebook 2 uses short markdown summaries, which make it a bit more compact—an advantage for advanced users. For most users, both are clear, with only a slight tradeoff between verbosity and succinctness.

<question_shortened>Code easy to reuse/adapt?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks present code in clean, well-segmented cells with minimal hardcoding or dataset-specific magic, making them easy to adapt or extend. Notebook 1 includes reusable plotting snippets for both population and single-ROI views; Notebook 2’s code is more focused but could be easily generalized. There is little difference in code reusability between the two—both could be adapted or modified easily by users with moderate familiarity.

<question_shortened>Understanding future analyses possible?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 explicitly mentions several possible advanced analyses and encourages adaptation, directly addressing new users’ likely interests. Notebook 2, while providing useful starting points, does not explicitly discuss extensions to more advanced or custom analyses, so users might not be inspired to go much further. Therefore, Notebook 1 is better for stimulating new analytic ideas and next-step planning.

<question_shortened>Overall helpfulness for getting started?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 provides a slightly more comprehensive entry point, with broader context-setting, explicit structural overviews, variety in visualizations, and better attention to suggesting further directions. Its only minor shortcoming is an occasionally confusing mask visualization when ROI masks are missing, but this is outweighed by its strengths. Notebook 2 is straightforward and effective as a quick, minimal working start, but is less nurturing for deeper, independent exploration. Thus, for a new user seeking to get started and soon move toward more complex analyses, Notebook 1 is the superior starting point overall.
