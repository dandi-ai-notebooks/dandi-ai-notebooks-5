<question_shortened>Understanding purpose and content of Dandiset</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks provide an introductory overview of Dandiset 001349, mentioning its use of calcium imaging data from developing mouse cortex and synchronization with behavioral data. Notebook 1 gives a concise yet effective statement about what the Dandiset contains and what is demonstrated in the notebook. Notebook 2 goes deeper in its "Overview," specifying the cortical area (primary somatosensory), explicitly listing the age range, and stating that behavioral video is included, not just behavioral data generally. It also lists more precisely what is covered in the notebook, setting clearer reader expectations. The file summary table for the Dandiset (Notebook 2) further orients new users to the Dandiset’s content, beyond just loading a single file.

<question_shortened>Confidence in accessing data types</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 demonstrates how to load a specific NWB file from DANDI, then programmatically access several types of signals (ΔF/F, z-score, events). However, it focuses on just the one file and does not summarize the availability of other files or how to systematically explore them. Notebook 2 offers a code block that lists a batch of NWB files from the Dandiset, providing their paths and file sizes, which is useful for orientation and batch-file access. For extracting data types within the file, both notebooks show how to drill into the NWB object (with similar code), but Notebook 2 more explicitly presents the available signal types and their uses in a summary table. Thus, Notebook 2 is slightly superior for instilling confidence in users accessing and understanding the full variety of data types in the Dandiset.

<question_shortened>Understanding NWB structure and how to work with it</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks demonstrate programmatic exploration of the NWB file structure via pynwb, showing how to extract specific data arrays. Notebook 1 explains the presence of several types of fluorescence measurements, accesses the ophys module, and makes clear how to retrieve and plot ROIs and imaging rates. Notebook 2 expands upon this by not only showing how to access a file’s main data, but also prints a metadata summary table extracted from the NWB file, including subject, session, and device metadata. This helps demystify the NWB container and orients the user to its structure. Notebook 2 also reinforces the different signal types with clear mapping between NWB keys and physiological meaning. Overall, both are good, but Notebook 2 does more to elucidate the file’s structural organization.

<question_shortened>Visualizations: helpful for data understanding?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks make effective use of visualizations—trace plots for neural signals, heatmaps for population activity, etc. Notebook 1 provides parallel plots for ΔF/F, z-score, and events for a single ROI, and a population heatmap, facilitating comparison across signal types and across ROIs. Notebook 2 does similar trace visualizations, but only for the first 10 ROIs (cells), showing both ΔF/F and calcium events. The calcium event plot in Notebook 2 improves readability using an axis offset per cell. However, Notebook 1’s approach gives a clearer look at the dynamics of a single cell across multiple metrics, and the heatmap offers population context. Overall, the visualizations in Notebook 1 are more varied, facilitating understanding of both single-cell and population-level data.

<question>5</question>
<question_shortened>Any poor/misleading visualizations?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook contains misleading visualizations; both have clear axes, appropriate labels, and use suitable plotting choices. However, Notebook 1’s population heatmap might become crowded if the number of ROIs is extremely high, but this is not a significant issue for the dataset at hand. Notebook 2, by plotting multiple cells with y-offsets for event traces, helps prevent overlap but may be slightly harder to interpret for beginners (the offset scale is arbitrary and needs attention in reading). Both approaches are effective, but neither introduces confusion or poor formatting that would hinder understanding in a meaningful way.

<question_shortened>Confidence in creating own visualizations after example</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks include accessible, well-structured matplotlib code to plot and explore neural signals, which can be readily adapted for user projects. Notebook 1 demonstrates how to plot multiple types of signals for a single ROI, a heatmap for all ROIs, and how to slice the data. Notebook 2 demonstrates time-series plotting across multiple cells with an offset trick for event data. However, Notebook 1’s separated subplots for different data types make it slightly clearer how to build different types of visualizations, and its code is more modular for adaptation. Thus, Notebook 1 edges ahead for confidence in reuse and adaptation.

<question>7</question>
<question_shortened>Visualizations show structure/complexity?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1’s heatmap of all ROIs’ z-scores is particularly illuminating for revealing the data’s population structure and temporal complexity. The single-ROI multipanel plots also highlight how the structure of different types of signals relate for a given cell. Notebook 2’s visualizations show multi-cell time series traces and event series, providing a sense of variability across cells, but do not have a heatmap or similar global view. Thus, Notebook 1’s combination of population and single-cell plots more effectively conveys the structural and temporal complexity of the dataset.

<question_shortened>Interpretations/conclusions: clarity and support?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook makes interpretive or analytical claims that are not well supported by the data or plots. Both keep to data visualization and technical access, rather than drawing scientific conclusions. In both, suggestions for next steps are general and consistent with the dataset’s content. There is no over-interpretation or unsupported assertion.

<question_shortened>Unnecessarily repetitive/redundant examples?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook is noticeably repetitive. Each presents one or two different visualization styles per kind of signal and does not re-plot the same thing in redundant ways. Notebook 1’s side-by-side plots serve a comparative purpose, and Notebook 2’s approaches are distinct (traces with/without offsets). There is no repetition that feels unnecessary in either notebook.

<question_shortened>Notebook as a guide to next analysis/questions</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks include useful lists of example analyses for the future (e.g., network structure, developmental analysis, correlation with behavior). Notebook 2 is more specific, for example, by mentioning batch processing and the use of external browser tools like Neurosift and the availability of LED triggers for synchronizing neural and behavioral data. It helps orient users to practical research directions. Notebook 1’s suggestions are also useful but are presented as more generic bullet points. Notebook 2’s “Practical Tips” section is especially encouraging for users considering further work.

Both notebooks are well-organized and clear. Notebook 2 is especially methodical in its structure, with headers like “Loading and Exploring an NWB File,” and offers summary tables to orient the user to the Dandiset's content and to the NWB metadata. The code blocks are logically ordered and the markdown clearly introduces each step. Notebook 1 is also clear, but is more concise and less explicit about notebook sections. Notebook 2 is more thorough and stepwise, which may help new users more.

<question_shortened>Code reusability/adaptability for Dandiset exploration</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks provide reusable code for loading NWB files, extracting data, and visualizing activity. Notebook 2’s file listing code (using pandas for tabulation) and metadata extraction are especially ready for adaptation, as is its practical use of batch processing and islice to survey the dataset. Notebook 1’s approach is also functional but tuned for single-file access and visualization. While both are good, Notebook 2 has more generalizable and batch-oriented code segments, making it more reusable for new users working across the Dandiset.
