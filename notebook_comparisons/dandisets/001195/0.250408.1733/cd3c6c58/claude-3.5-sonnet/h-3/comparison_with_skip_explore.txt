<question_shortened>Helpfulness for Dandiset purpose/content</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 provides a concise but somewhat generic overview of the Dandiset's scientific purpose, mentioning the focus on DRN dopamine projections and brain regions but without much detail. Notebook 2 offers a slightly richer description in the overview, specifying not only the overall goal (linking DRN dopamine neurons to social state in mice) but also the approaches used (electrophysiology, optogenetics) and the experimental focus on different projection targets. This additional context makes it easier for a new reader to understand both what the Dandiset represents and what is being measured/studied.

<question_shortened>Confidence accessing data</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks show how to use the DANDI API to locate and load NWB files from the archive. Notebook 2, however, goes further by displaying a sample of file paths/sizes using a loop (explicitly listing multiple assets), which helps the reader see the dataset's breadth and gain confidence in accessing various files. The batch processing section in Notebook 2 also makes it clearer how one can systematically access and process multiple files. Notebook 1 is adequate but gives a more limited, single-file focus.

<question>3</question>
<question_shortened>Understanding NWB structure</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 highlights NWB loading and shows how to access individual datasets for stimulus and response. However, Notebook 2 goes deeper: it systematically extracts and prints rich metadata (including lab_meta_data), lists available stimulus protocols, and provides example batch processing for metadata extraction across files. The explicit demonstration of extracting data fields and more diverse metadata in Notebook 2 offers better guidance for users to explore and understand the NWB data structure.

<question>4</question>
<question_shortened>Visualization usefulness</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 shows a single sweep with straightforward stimulus/response plots, which is helpful for initial understanding. Notebook 2, however, plots three sweeps in a stacked format, overlays both membrane potential and injected current with twin axes, and uses clearer labeling/legending, which gives the user a deeper look into the data's features and variability. The visualizations in Notebook 2 therefore provide better insight into the data across sweeps and overall are more informative.

<question>5</question>
<question_shortened>Visualization clarity/problematics</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks present clear, well-labeled plots with appropriate axes and units, and neither contains misleading or confusing visual displays. However, Notebook 2's use of twin axes (voltage and current), legends, and consistent formatting improve clarity further. The overall appearance and interpretation are at least as good in Notebook 2, with no evidence of confusion introduced in either. If anything, Notebook 2 resolves potential ambiguities that may arise from a single y-axis display.

<question>6</question>
<question_shortened>Confidence in making own visualizations</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks present clear plotting code. Notebook 1 gives a simple, reusable plot function for a single sweep, while Notebook 2 shows how to plot multiple sweeps and use twin y-axes, as well as handling units and extracting relevant fields from the NWB file. For users wanting to create new or varied visualizations, the approaches in Notebook 2 (looping, labeling, plotting multiple traces, twin axes) provide more robust examples and inspire greater confidence for future custom plots.

<question>7</question>
<question_shortened>Visualizing data structure/complexity</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 focuses on a single example sweep. In contrast, Notebook 2 visualizes three sweeps side-by-side, allowing users to perceive differences or similarities across protocols or conditions. Additionally, the batch processing code and the explicit listing of stimulus protocols let users mentally map the broader data structure and complexity available in the archive, supporting a better grasp of the data's richness.

<question_shortened>Interpretations/conclusions clarity</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks restrict their interpretations mostly to the description of plotted data, sticking to factual explanations (e.g., summary of protocols, visualization interpretations) and avoid overreaching claims. Neither makes questionable conclusions unsupported by the data shown. Overall, both are equally clear and cautious in their interpretations, sticking to what is visible or available in the notebook.

<question>9</question>
<question_shortened>Repetition/redundancy of plots</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook feels repetitiveâ€”the number of plots is appropriate for orientation to the data. Notebook 1 shows a single sweep, while Notebook 2 presents three, but the latter's use is justified for displaying variability rather than redundancy. There is no unnecessary repetition or redundant code in either notebook.

<question_shortened>Understanding possible next analyses</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks list next analysis ideas (firing pattern analysis, region comparisons, cell-type responses in Notebook 1; protocol and region comparisons, optogenetics, meta-analysis in Notebook 2), but Notebook 2's coverage of metadata, batch processing, and explicit organization of sweep types gives a clearer sense of the data's breadth and encourages a wider range of possible analyses. The batch-processing section in Notebook 2 is especially helpful for users to conceptualize larger-scale analyses.

<question_shortened>Clarity/ease of following</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks are structured logically and progress from overview to data access to analysis to summary of next steps. However, Notebook 2 includes more comments, subheadings, and organized code/markdown explanations, making it slightly easier to follow for a new user. The explicit sectioning for protocol summaries and batch analysis help orient the user more clearly to both code and data.

<question>12</question>
<question_shortened>Reusability/adaptability of code</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2 excels in code reusability by providing explicit example functions for extracting metadata and setting up batch analyses across files, as well as having flexible NWB extraction functions and structured plotting code. Notebook 1 focuses mostly on loading and plotting a single sweep, with less emphasis on generalizing to other files or processing at scale.

<question_shortened>Next steps: question coverage</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2 covers a wider variety of analysis possibilities (meta-analysis, optogenetics, batch comparisons, aggregate results), and the batch code and file listing reinforce these opportunities. Notebook 1 mentions some of the same general analysis opportunities, but does not provide as much actionable code or workflow examples.

Both notebooks are useful for onboarding a new user.
