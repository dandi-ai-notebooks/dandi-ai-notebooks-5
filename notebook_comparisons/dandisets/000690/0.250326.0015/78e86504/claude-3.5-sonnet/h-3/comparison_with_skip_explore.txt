<question_shortened>Purpose/content understanding</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 provides a detailed overview of the Dandiset’s scientific goal, specifying the pathway studied (thalamus to hippocampus) and the nature of the stimuli and recordings (types of visual stimuli, brain regions, and recording technology). Notebook 2’s introduction is more general, mentioning extracellular recordings from visual cortex, but without emphasizing the multi-region, pathway-spanning nature of the dataset up front. Notebook 1 helps readers frame the Dandiset's broader scientific importance, while Notebook 2 focuses more on what will be covered technically. However, Notebook 2 is clear about the presence of behavioral data, which is less explicit in Notebook 1.

<question_shortened>Accessing different data types</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 focuses primarily on LFP data and electrode metadata, but does not illustrate how to access spike or behavioral data. Notebook 2, by contrast, explicitly distinguishes between spike ("*_image.nwb") and LFP files, lists both, and loads example spike data. It also demonstrates access to running wheel and eye tracking signals. Overall, the second notebook covers a broader range of data access patterns in this dataset.

<question_shortened>NWB structure & working with files</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 explores the NWB electrode table and session metadata, offering some NWB structure insight, but focuses mainly on electrodes and LFP. Notebook 2 provides a more in-depth look at the structure by introducing the split between *_image.nwb vs other files, retrieving both unit/spike and behavioral data, and exploring stimulus templates. The explicit separation of data types and the demonstration of accessing units, electrodes, intervals, and stimulus templates give Notebook 2 an edge in helping a user understand the NWB file organization and contents for this Dandiset.

<question_shortened>Visualizations helping data understanding</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 features clear, publication-style visualizations for LFP signals (multi-channel traces and a spectrogram), and an informative scatterplot of electrode positions. Notebook 2 offers informative figures as well: a histogram for spike counts, running wheel and pupil tracking over time, alongside a demo of aligning spikes to a stimulus. Both notebooks’ visualizations are helpful for understanding the type and breadth of the data available. However, Notebook 2 covers more types of signals and provides complementary visualizations (spikes, behavior, stimulus-alignment). Both succeed, but the breadth in Notebook 2 adds value, even if the plotting quality is slightly more basic.

<question>5</question>
<question_shortened>Problems/misleading or hard visualizations</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook had visualizations that were overtly misleading or confusing, but Notebook 1’s LFP time axis is ambiguous—it may be plotting samples instead of seconds, and has a strange dynamic range for the y-axis, which could confuse readers not familiar with LFP units. Notebook 2’s plots are straightforward, with axes, units, and titles clear. Both could have improved with more annotation, but Notebook 1 has a minor drawback in the LFP time axis.

<question_shortened>Confidence to create own visualizations</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks show practical code examples leading to standard visualizations, such as line plots, scatterplots, histograms, and spectrograms. Notebook 2, however, covers a wider range—spikes, behavior, and stimulus structure—which may give users more ideas for adaptation. The figure code is easy to adapt or copy in both, but Notebook 2’s variety slightly improves confidence for a user wanting to branch out to new types of visualizations.

<question_shortened>Visualization of data structure/complexity</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 visualizes electrode locations and LFP, which demonstrates multichannel structure but not unit or interval complexity. Notebook 2 visualizes spike count distributions, behavioral traces, and stimulus template shapes—collectively illustrating the multiplicity and complexity of the dataset’s contents. It presents more axes of complexity (units, signals, time, condition) and thus offers a better window into the structure.

<question>8</question>
<question_shortened>Unsupported/unclear interpretations or conclusions</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks largely avoid over-interpretation and do not offer strong claims not supported by shown data. Notebook 1 remains largely descriptive, while Notebook 2 provides concrete numbers alongside its plots (e.g., count of spikes in an interval) without drawing interpretive conclusions. Neither notebook has unclear or unsupported conclusions, so neither stands out here.

<question_shortened>Helpfulness for next questions/analyses</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks end with a “next steps” section, suggesting possible analyses. Notebook 1 is more general in its recommendations (LFP pattern comparison, responses to stimuli, etc.) and is mostly LFP-centric, while Notebook 2 shows concrete code for aligning spikes to stimuli, examining behavioral signals, and more specifically suggests analysis connecting these modalities. Thus, Notebook 2 provides a more actionable launchpad for multimodal and sophisticated analyses.

<question_shortened>Clarity and ease of following</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks are well-structured, with section headers, short markdown descriptions, and logical flow from data loading to analysis/visualization. Notebook 2 covers more material and more complex data, but it remains segmentable and clear throughout. The main differentiator is the breadth of its content, but this is managed without sacrificing readability. Both are clear, but Notebook 2’s greater scope might slightly increase cognitive load for complete beginners; however, overall, it’s equally approachable to those with basic Python/NWB skills.

<question_shortened>Code reusability/adaptability</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks offer modular, well-commented code cells suitable for adaptation. Notebook 2’s broader coverage (retrieving multiple data types, more slicing/filtering examples) means there is more code for a user to reuse for varied goals. In particular, users interested in spike/behavioral/stimulus analyses will find more direct, copy-paste–ready utility in Notebook 2.

<question_shortened>Help understanding next analyses</question_shortened>
<rationale>
This question closely resembles question 10. Notebook 2’s coverage of spike timing alignment, behavioral signals, and stimulus lookup makes it more effective for communicating possible analyses one can pursue (e.g., response to stimuli, behavioral state correlations). Notebook 1, by comparison, restricts itself to LFP-dominated analyses. Thus, Notebook 2 is more helpful here for understanding potential next analyses.

Overall, Notebook 2 is more helpful for new users. It covers broader data modalities (LFP, spikes, behavior, stimulus and intervals), demonstrates more access/analysis strategies, and better illustrates the multidimensional nature of this Dandiset. While both notebooks are clear and functional, and Notebook 1 is good for LFP and electrode exploration, Notebook 2 serves as a stronger foundation for getting started with the full dataset.
