<question_shortened>Understanding Dandiset purpose & content</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 starts with a concise overview section, outlining the scientific goals, experimental paradigm, techniques, and the specific types of data present in Dandiset 000690. It clearly summarizes what the Dandiset contains, linking back to the online page and explaining what the reader will learn in the notebook. Notebook 2 also provides a detailed introduction, emphasizing the multimodal aspects of the dataset (neural, behavioral, stimulus). Its "About this Notebook" and mid-level bullet points give a broader context for the types of files and the experiment. 
Notebook 1 is a little more focused on the organizational structure and emphasizes electrophysiology, whereas Notebook 2 highlights the variety of data modalities and explicitly talks about "multimodal" composition. Both do a good job overall, but Notebook 2's introduction is slightly more comprehensive in listing all aspects (neural, behavioral, stimulus) and what to expect in the notebook.

<question_shortened>Confidently access different data types</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 primarily demonstrates how to access LFP and electrode metadata via the DANDI API and NWB, walking through connecting to the archive and selecting files, but it focuses only on one electrophysiology file. Notebook 2, on the other hand, opens with asset discovery for the entire Dandiset and differentiates between several key file types, showing how to select between LFP and "image" files. It also procedurally covers neural, behavioral, and stimulus data (i.e., it doesn't just show a single pathway but several), giving the user clearer guidance on how to access varied data modalities. This makes it easier for the user to generalize access to different data types.

<question_shortened>Understanding & working with NWB structure</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 gives a detailed printout of the NWB object and steps through accessing electrodes, LFP data, and metadata tables in a relatively clear way for a single file. It shows how to use h5py and pynwb to read fields. However, Notebook 2 provides a broader session summary, explores the unit tables (including spike train indexing and metadata), stimulus templates, interval tables, and behavioral recordings. It shows how to enumerate components at various levels of the NWB structure. While both are solid, Notebook 2's approach covers more facets of the NWB standard and exposes more functionality relevant to this dataset.

<question_shortened>Helpfulness of visualizations for understanding</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 provides visualizations for channel region counts, channel probe positions, and LFP traces. These plots are functional and aid in understanding probe structure and signal. Notebook 2 includes histograms of spike counts per unit, previews of visual stimulus frames, and plots of behavioral signals (running, eye tracking). These latter plots are very relevant to understanding the breadth of the dataset, demonstrating multiple types of relationships and time courses. While both notebooks' visualizations are clear, those in Notebook 2 are more varied and illustrative of the dataset's multimodal nature.

<question_shortened>Visualizations that hinder understanding</question_shortened>
<rationale>
All visualizations in both notebooks are appropriately labeled and relatively clear. There are minor axis label overlaps on some of the bar/chat plots but nothing that would mislead or obscure interpretation. In Notebook 2, the vertical axis labels and color choices on density or behavioral signal plots are all standard and helpful. Notebook 1's plots (e.g. vertical position by region) are quite informative, although a reader new to the terminology might not understand every abbreviation. Overall, neither notebook contains plots that hinder understanding more than the other.

<question_shortened>Confidence in creating own visualizations</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks provide a good range of plotting code for different data types, demonstrating selection, slicing, and plotting with matplotlib and pandas. Notebook 2 steps across modalities (spikes, behavior, stimuli), giving more templates for stitching together new analysis pathways. Notebook 1 is restricted to electrode/LFP plots, which may limit the reader's inspiration for multimodal plotting. Thus, Notebook 2 leaves the reader with stronger foundations for building their own customized visualizations, especially across different data streams.

<question_shortened>Visualizations showing structure/complexity</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 visualizes electrode position/labels, and LFP channels, helping with understanding the physical and anatomical structure. Notebook 2, however, demonstrates the per-unit spike count heterogeneity, sample frames from stimuli, and behavioral time series, alluding more strongly to the dataset's complexity and richness. By visualizing actual stimulus frames, population neural distributions, and behavioral signals, Notebook 2 enables a more comprehensive appreciation of the experiment's dimensionality and complexity.

<question_shortened>Clarity/support for interpretations/conclusions</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks present mostly conservative, well-supported interpretations and do not over-claim. Notebook 1's interpretation sections are minimal and mostly descriptive ("Here are the possible next steps"), whereas Notebook 2 annotates the results of visualizations (e.g., spike counts, behavioral signal trends) and makes clear, plausible interpretive comments. No claims go beyond what is shown, and the rationale for QC/status assessments is well explained in each. Slightly more interpretive context is given in Notebook 2 (e.g., about QC, spike count distributions, the meaning of signals), but both are clear and justified.

<question_shortened>Unnecessary repetition/redundancy</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook suffers from significant redundancy. Notebook 1 stays focused on electrodes/LFP with no repetitive plots. Notebook 2 covers many data types with little overlap between visualizations or text. Both transition across logical sections cleanly, keeping new content in each section. Thus, there is no clear preference.

<question_shortened>Understanding next steps/analyses</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 provides a set of practical suggestions for next steps at the endâ€”such as exploring spikes/events, performing more detailed analyses, or comparing regions/animals. Notebook 2 repeatedly foregrounds what the user can do with each data type, even showing example code for aligning spikes to stimulus presentations, and suggests population, alignment, and more complex analyses in its closing section. In addition, Notebook 2 explicitly lists future analysis possibilities at entry and exit, connecting code sections to downstream research-style workflows. Both are helpful, but Notebook 2 creates a stronger bridge between the explored content and possible research analyses.

<question_shortened>Clarity and ease of following</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks are well structured, with logical section headers and code-comment-explanation cycles. Notebook 2 is slightly more verbose, with clear section summaries and transition statements that help guide the reader through modalities. Notebook 1 is briefer and to the point, which may appeal to some users, but may also leave gaps for those unfamiliar with the data types. For a non-expert seeking onboarding, Notebook 2 is slightly easier to follow.

<question_shortened>Code reusability/adaptability</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks offer practical code blocks that can be reused. Notebook 2's code, by offering multi-modal data selects and slice operations, stimulus/frame access, and alignment examples, provides more comprehensive templates for a range of use cases likely encountered by new users. Notebook 1's code is simple and functional, but is limited in scope to LFP/electrodes, so is less reusable for multimodal investigations. As such, Notebook 2's coverage gives readers more readily adaptable snippets for various workflows.

(This is nearly identical to question 10: in effect, "next steps.") Notebook 1 provides a list of possible directions such as spike analysis and regional comparisons. Notebook 2, in addition to closing suggestions, shows in detail how to structure analyses aligning spikes to stimuli or extracting behavioral correlates, and lists many extensions throughout the notebook. The concrete code examples for advanced manipulations drive home multiple possible analysis paths.

<question_shortened>Overall helpfulness for getting started</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks are quality introductions and lower the barrier to working with Dandiset 000690. However, Notebook 2, by virtue of its broader coverage (neural, behavioral, stimulus), comprehensive code, interpretive guidance, and repeated cues toward further research, is a stronger onboarding resource for beginners and advanced users alike. It empowers users to move seamlessly from file selection, modalities, basic exploration, and into custom analyses. Notebook 1 is a fine and focused resource for the LFP/electrode subset, but is not as complete for the Dandiset's full scope.
