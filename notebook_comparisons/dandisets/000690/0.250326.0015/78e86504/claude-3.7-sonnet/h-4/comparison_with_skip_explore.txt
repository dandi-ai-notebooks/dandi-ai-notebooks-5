<question>1</question>
<question_shortened>Understanding Dandiset purpose/content</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks provide a summary of the Dandiset and its scientific aims at the outset. Notebook 1 gives a detailed textual overview about the scientific question (“how visual representations evolve across brain regions...”), the dataset structure, and experimental context. Notebook 2 is briefer at the start, but does list what kinds of data are included and describes the neural and behavioral data types, focusing more on practical contents. The background section in Notebook 1 more explicitly connects the dataset’s purpose to biological questions, while Notebook 2 transitions quickly to describing data types and file structures.

<question>2</question>
<question_shortened>Confidently accessing different Dandiset data types</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2 does a clearer job illustrating how to distinguish and access the main types of files: it explicitly separates `*_image.nwb` files (for spike/unit data) from probe-specific LFP NWB files, and uses code to classify and summarize them. The discussion of what’s in each file type is clearer and more categorical. Notebook 1 mentions named files for an individual subject but doesn’t clearly explain what’s in the “image” files or contrast their purposes. Notebook 2’s summary of files by type creates more confidence in knowing where to find different data modalities.

<question>3</question>
<question_shortened>NWB structure and working with NWB</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2 provides a more comprehensive illustration of NWB file structure by walking through a representative `*_image.nwb`—showing overall session metadata, then exploring units, electrodes, stimulus templates, intervals, behavioral data, and alignments in turn. Notebook 1 focuses more on probe-specific LFP NWB files, drilling into subject, electrodes, and probe groups, but omits units/spike data and the behavioral/stimulus richness of the main “image” NWB. While both show NWB info and usage, Notebook 2 covers more generality (units, behavioral, stimulus, electrophys), thus giving a fuller sense of NWB structure in this Dandiset.

<question>4</question>
<question_shortened>Did visualizations help understanding?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks feature relevant and generally clear visualizations. Notebook 1’s visualizations are focused on LFP and electrode arrays: e.g., probe layouts, 3D electrode positions, LFP traces, heatmaps, power spectra. Notebook 2’s visualizations cover spike statistics, stimulus images, running/eye behavioral traces, and give a broader perspective on the dataset’s scientific usage. Notebook 1’s graphics aid in understanding spatial/ephys structure; Notebook 2’s visuals aid more in understanding overall experimental content and multimodal integration. The different focuses are both valid, but Notebook 2's visuals help grasp the multimodal potential of the Dandiset.

<question>5</question>
<question_shortened>Did any visualizations make things harder to understand?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook contains visualizations that are actively misleading or confusing. All axis labels, titles and colorbars are provided and generally clear. Notebook 2’s figures (e.g., spike count histogram, behavioral signals) are straightforward and easy to interpret. Notebook 1’s many spatial plots (3D/2D electrode locations, brain region bars) are well-labeled but potentially less meaningful without more context for unfamiliar users, though still not misleading. Minor differences, but both are solid.

<question>6</question>
<question_shortened>Confidence creating own visualizations</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 is stronger for spatial and probe/electrode-LFP visualizations, showing various matplotlib constructions, including 3D plotting, scatter layouts, and multi-channel traces. Notebook 2 demonstrates typical neuroscientific analyses (spike count distributions, peri-stimulus alignment, stimulus frame plotting, running/eye traces). Both use straightforward matplotlib code, but Notebook 2’s broader coverage (spikes, stimulus, behavioral data) means the user is exposed to more template code they could adapt to a wider array of analyses.

<question>7</question>
<question_shortened>Visualization of structure/complexity of data</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2 shows the data’s structure and multimodality more vividly by visualizing spike counts per unit, stimulus frames, behavioral time series, and the relationship between spikes and stimulus presentation intervals. Notebook 1’s visualizations reveal detailed spatial and LFP/channel structure (which is important), but less of the richness and complexity across the behavioral and stimulus aspects of the data. For appreciating the dataset’s full structure, Notebook 2 is more comprehensive.

<question>8</question>
<question_shortened>Clarity/support for conclusions/interpretations</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks are descriptive and cautious, avoiding over-interpretation. Notebook 1 offers concise “Summary and Next Steps” that accurately reflects the analyses shown. Notebook 2’s summary is thorough and matches the analyses—every assertion is shown with code or figure, and descriptions of data structure are supported with output. Neither makes unsupported claims, and everything is tied to a visualization or table. No evidence of unclear or internally unjustified conclusions in either.

<question>9</question>
<question_shortened>Redundant/repetitive plots or examples?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 includes multiple visualizations of electrode properties and brain regions (2D, 3D, bar plots), some of which might feel a bit redundant to users just interested in a basic survey, though each view gives slightly different information. Notebook 2’s plots are more minimal, with each plot showcasing a different data modality; no examples feel repetitive. However, Notebook 1’s redundancy is not excessive—in both cases, repetition is minor.

<question>10</question>
<question_shortened>Understanding possible next questions/analyses</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks offer “next steps” suggestions at the end. Notebook 2’s recommendations (“tuning curves,” “population coding,” “relation to behavior,” “eye movement analysis,” etc.) are more specific to visual neuroscience and directly leverage all three data domains (spikes, stimuli, and behavior) explored in the notebook. Notebook 1 suggests spike sorting, looking at stimuli, and more anatomical exploration, but is less explicit about advanced analyses afforded by the data. Thus, Notebook 2 better primes the user for downstream, scientifically relevant questions.

<question_shortened>Clarity and ease of following</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks are clearly organized with progressive code and output, and provide well-commented Markdown headers. Notebook 2’s structure (metadata → file structure → units → stimuli → behavior → alignment) follows a narrative arc more tied to typical analysis workflows, making it easier for new users to follow and see how one analysis leads to another. Notebook 1 sometimes feels like a series of exploratory code snippets rather than a continuous pedagogical workflow. Both are readable, but Notebook 2 is somewhat smoother as a learning narrative.

<question>12</question>
<question_shortened>Reusability/adaptability of code</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks provide modular, well-commented code blocks. However, Notebook 2 is explicit about code chunks for listing and classifying files, walking through NWB fields (including with fallback code and flexible printing), analyzing and plotting behavior, unit, and stimulus data, which would be easily copy-pasted to adapt to other files or sessions. Notebook 1’s code is straightforward for electrode and LFP analysis, but less generalizable to other kinds of data in the Dandiset, especially for users who want spike- or stimulus-centric analyses.

<question_shortened>Overall helpfulness for getting started</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks are high-quality, but Notebook 2 stands out for breadth of coverage, emphasis on real scientific use cases, and clarity in mapping data modalities to analysis steps. A new user interested in actually using Dandiset 000690—for spikes, LFP, behavioral, or stimulus analyses—would get a more complete, “big picture” template from Notebook 2, and find it easier to adapt the code and workflow to their own research. Notebook 1 is stronger for spatial/technical LFP explorations, but this is a narrower subset of potential analyses.
