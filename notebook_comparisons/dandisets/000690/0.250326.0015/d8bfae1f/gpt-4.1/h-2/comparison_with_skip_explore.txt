<question_shortened>Understanding Dandiset purpose/content</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 provides a concise and clear overview section summarizing the project, data modalities, and scientific motivation. It explicitly lists the types of stimuli, recording techniques, data formats, and even scope of data (LFP, spikes, metadata) in an accessible bulleted format, linking directly to the Dandiset online. Notebook 2 also gives an informative overview, but is slightly more diffuse—while it mentions multimodal data, scientific context, and the inclusion of behavior and intervals, it is a bit less focused in bullet form. Notebook 1's explicit list and breakdown helps a new user rapidly understand what to expect. Both are strong, but Notebook 1 is clearer and more direct.

<question_shortened>Confident in accessing Dandiset data types</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2 covers more data modalities: LFP, spikes, running speed, eye tracking, and intervals, showing direct code for locating and extracting each, and making clear which files (e.g., *_image.nwb) contain which data types. Notebook 1 is excellent for LFP and electrode metadata, but does not demo spike or behavioral/stimulus data extraction or visualizations. If a user wants to be confident accessing all major Dandiset data, Notebook 2 covers this better.

<question_shortened>Understanding NWB format and structure</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 devotes clear code and discussion to displaying NWB file structure, especially for acquisition data, subject/session fields, electrode tables, etc. The printout of the NWBFile object and field breakdowns enhance structural understanding. Notebook 2 focuses more on directly extracting target data, providing less direct exploration of the file's full structure and organization, which could help orient new users to NWB. Therefore, for learning NWB's organization in the context of this Dandiset, Notebook 1 has a notable advantage.

<question>4</question>
<question_shortened>Visualization clarity and utility</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks make helpful visualizations, but with somewhat different emphases. Notebook 1 shines in visualizing electrode locations and regional coverage, and LFP traces with regional annotation. Notebook 2 visualizes more modalities (LFP, spike raster, running, pupil, stimulus intervals), providing an integrated look at the experiment. Although some of Notebook 2's data (e.g., y-units on the LFP and pupil plots) could be clearer, the breadth of modalities visualized is a strength. Overall, Notebook 2 offers more examples of how the data are structured and how to visualize diverse aspects, which is more generally helpful for new users.

<question>5</question>
<question_shortened>Problems with visualizations</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook presents visualizations that are actively misleading, but there are some issues: Notebook 2's LFP x-axis is in sample index rather than time, and the pupil diameter y-axis is labeled as meters (which seems unrealistic) and is likely a proxy unit. Notebook 1 uses clear axes, offsets, and annotations, especially in the electrode/region plots. While both are generally acceptable, Notebook 1's visualizations come with more careful axis labeling and annotation, avoiding potential confusion.

<question>6</question>
<question_shortened>Confidence in making own visualizations</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2's range of visualization examples—covering neural, behavioral, and stimulus-tabular data—models a broad set of "recipes" for the user to adapt: event plots, rasters, time series for multiple modalities, and classic LFP line plots. While Notebook 1's examples are well-done for LFP and electrode spatial distributions, it covers only those domains. Therefore, Notebook 2 better builds confidence that a user could extend or remix the code for their own use cases across experimental dimensions.

<question_shortened>Visualizations show data complexity/structure</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 excels in showing channel organization—region counts, spatial arrangement on probes, and annotated structure of the electrode table. Notebook 2 surpasses it by showing complexity across *multiple modalities*—from spike trains, to behavior, to intervals, demonstrating the rich multimodal structure of the dataset. Therefore, while Notebook 1 shows complexity within LFP/electrode metadata, Notebook 2 better captures the overall breadth and complexity.

<question>8</question>
<question_shortened>Interpretations/conclusions clarity/support</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks mostly limit themselves to "observations" immediately supported by plots or printed data, without making broad unsupported claims. There are no major interpretive leaps. Any issues are minor (e.g., possibly ambiguous pupil units in Notebook 2, but it is labeled as a proxy). Generally, both are cautious and responsible, so neither stands out significantly here.

Neither notebook contains significant redundancy: each visualization and example reveals a distinct aspect of the data. Notebook 2 moves through different data modalities; Notebook 1 explores channel/region/metadata in more detail. No examples feel like unnecessary repetition in either.

<question_shortened>Understanding next steps/analyses</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks provide a closing section summarizing possible next steps and analyses. Notebook 2, however, links the code examples to specific next analyses more tightly (e.g., peri-stimulus and cross-region analyses), and provides more context for "where to go next" with the dataset. Notebook 1's suggestions remain at a slightly higher level and are less informed by the hands-on diversity present in Notebook 2.

<question>11</question>
<question_shortened>Clarity and organization</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks are well structured, use section headers, and clearly describe what each code block is doing. Notebook 1 is perhaps slightly more linear and clean, with explicit callouts before each major code block and direct labeling. Notebook 2, with its table of contents, internal section links, and broader scope, is slightly more complex, but this is mitigated by its organization. The differences are minor; both are clear and easy to follow, albeit with slight tradeoffs between simplicity and breadth.

<question>12</question>
<question_shortened>Code reusability/adaptability</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2 contains more "templates" for accessing and plotting different types of data beyond LFPs (e.g., spike rasters, event intervals, behavior), making it more readily reusable for users who want to access the full richness of the Dandiset. Notebook 1's code is excellent for LFP/electrode exploration, and has clean code blocks, but would require the user to supplement it heavily for exploring spike, behavior, or stimulus event data. Thus, Notebook 2 is preferable for its broader and more copy-paste-ready code.

This is nearly identical to Question 10. Both notebooks point to analysis avenues, but Notebook 2 more concretely links its code to analytic possibilities (peri-event analysis, cross-modalities, etc.). It also explicitly lists how the examples connect to potential user analyses.

<rationale>
Notebook 2 provides a more comprehensive, practical, and example-rich introduction to Dandiset 000690 for a user who wants to rapidly get oriented across all main data modalities, with a wide variety of reusable code snippets and visualizations. Notebook 1 is especially strong for someone focusing only on LFP/electrode/metadata exploration, with excellent explanations and clean structure, but is less broad. Thus, while both are strong, Notebook 2 is overall more helpful for most new users.
