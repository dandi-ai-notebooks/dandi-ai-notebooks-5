<question_shortened>Helpfulness for understanding Dandiset purpose/content</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 provides a clear overview of the Dandiset’s scientific aim ("surface vessel diameter and pulsatility"), includes a very explicit dataset description and direct link, and succinctly lists what the notebook demonstrates. However, Notebook 2 gives a more detailed biological background (mentioning "thinned skull preparations" and "high-frame-rate grayscale imaging") and clearly outlines the notebook’s coverage in a numbered list before moving to methods. Overall, while both are effective, Notebook 2 offers a slightly more comprehensive introduction and a breakdown of notebook contents, which may benefit new users.

<question_shortened>Confidence in accessing Dandiset data types</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks demonstrate how to access NWB files using the DANDI API and retrieve imaging data. Notebook 1 gives a step-by-step approach for retrieving a single file, while Notebook 2 lists all NWB files in the Dandiset, shows their sizes, and provides a reusable loading function that generalizes to any file. This reusable function makes Notebook 2 more adaptable for users wishing to explore more than one dataset, and the asset summary helps clarify the contents of the Dandiset.

<question>3</question>
<question_shortened>Understanding NWB file structure and usage</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 inspects the NWB subject and session metadata, prints session information, and directly retrieves image data from the "Movies" acquisition. Notebook 2, in addition to showing subject/session metadata, includes a generalized file loading function highlighting the key acquisition group and data access pattern. It also prints the full session description and distinguishes the reporting of “sex”, which is a NWB subject attribute, demonstrating a broader survey of NWB fields. Thus, Notebook 2 is marginally more informative for understanding NWB structure and for guiding extension to other acquisition types.

<question_shortened>Helpfulness of visualizations for understanding data</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 shows the first and a middle frame of the recording side by side, as well as a plot of mean intensity over time in a central region. Notebook 2 goes further by creating a grid of six evenly spaced frames, giving a better picture of variability and continuity over the session’s timecourse. Its intensity analysis extracts a more targeted vessel-based trace (through the vessel center), enhancing context for physiological pulsatility. Overall, Notebook 2’s visualizations are richer and more targeted for exploring vessel properties.

<question>5</question>
<question_shortened>Did any visualization make things harder to understand?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
None of the visualizations in either notebook were misleading or poorly formatted. Axes and colorbars are present where appropriate. Notebook 2’s multi-frame plot increases clarity rather than confusion. Both notebooks use clear titles and legends. There is no evidence of mislabeling or confusing display.

<question>6</question>
<question_shortened>Confidence in creating own visualizations after examples</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both provide good, practical matplotlib code for accessing and visualizing image series. Notebook 2 provides a more general and reusable loading function, as well as examples for plotting multiple frames and intensity traces on data subsets (e.g., along the vessel). These offer a broader template base for custom visualizations, boosting user confidence.

<question>7</question>
<question_shortened>How well did visualizations show data structure/complexity?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 visualizes two selected frames and a mean region-intensity trace, which is informative but limited in capturing complexity and temporal evolution. Notebook 2’s selection of six frames spaced throughout the session better illustrates variability and stability, while the vessel intensity trace clarifies where to look for physiological signals. These choices better highlight both the structure and possible complexity of the dataset.

<question>8</question>
<question_shortened>Clarity and support of interpretations/conclusions</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks are careful to avoid over-interpretation, mostly describing rather than explaining results. Interpretive text is minimal and generally well supported by the plots. There are no unsupported or ambiguous claims in either. Both clearly note what the user can or might do, but avoid presenting conclusions premature for the material shown.

<question>9</question>
<question_shortened>Unnecessary repetition/redundancy in plots/examples</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1: Every plot or visualization has a unique purpose (first frame, middle frame, mean intensity). Notebook 2: Likewise, all visualizations are distinct and illustrate different aspects. Notebook 2’s six-frame grid could verge on redundancy if all frames were similar, but the step-wise spacing is justified in exploring time course and is not excessive. No unnecessary repetition was found in either notebook.

<question>10</question>
<question_shortened>Helpfulness for understanding possible next analyses/questions</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks have strong “next steps” or “potential analyses” sections at the end. Notebook 1 lists relevant scientific questions (diameter, pulsatility, Radon transform, full-width at half maximum) and ties these to keywords. Notebook 2’s listing is more detailed and methodical, explicitly listing types of analyses (diameter quantification, method comparison, cross-subject analyses, etc.). Both are very useful, but Notebook 2 is somewhat more concrete in mapping the dataset to analysis types.

<question_shortened>Clarity and ease of following the notebook</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks are highly readable, with section headings and clear ordering of text, code, and plots. Notebook 2’s use of bulleted/numbered lists for structure and a more systematic organization of workflow are slight improvements. Its inclusion of best practices also aids in clarity. However, differences are relatively minor—both are accessible.

<question>12</question>
<question_shortened>Ease of reusing/adapting code</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1’s code is clear but specialized to a single NWB file. Notebook 2’s publishing of a general-purpose NWB file loading function (with parameters) makes its code much easier to reuse or adapt for different files within the dataset. Additionally, Notebook 2 also gives a code example to list all NWB files and print their basic information, which directly supports scaling and generalization.

<question_shortened>Overall helpfulness for getting started with the Dandiset</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 is solid and covers the essentials for a first exploration. However, Notebook 2 improves on it at almost every step: more context, clear function-based code for re-use, broader and richer visualization, and better mapping between dataset and possible analyses. It also offers practical workflow and “best practice” advice that will help a wider range of users.
