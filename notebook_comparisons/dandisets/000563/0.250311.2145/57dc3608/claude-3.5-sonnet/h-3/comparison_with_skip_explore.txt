<question>1</question>
<question_shortened>How well did the notebook explain the Dandiset's purpose/content?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 begins with a clear "Overview" and bullet points outlining the specific aims of the data and what the notebook will cover, which is direct and helpful. Notebook 2 also provides a thorough description, mentioning more details about the experimental setup (e.g., Neuropixels, running behavior, eye tracking, optogenetics). Its "Notebook Contents" section is slightly more detailed in previewing analyses. However, Notebook 1 provides a conceptually focused introduction, while Notebook 2 offers a broader factual context. Both are strong, but Notebook 2 gives deeper context for what types of experimental data are present and how they relate to the scientific question.

<question>2</question>
<question_shortened>Does the notebook show how to access different data types?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 shows how to access LFP data, electrode data, and session/subject information, but does not demonstrate access to spike, stimulus, behavioral, or optogenetic data. Notebook 2 demonstrates access to spike times, stimulus intervals and parameters, behavioral data (running speed), and optogenetic intervals, covering a broader range of modalities. This makes it clearer how to access most of the key data types available in the Dandiset.

<question>3</question>
<question_shortened>Did the notebook help understand NWB file structure?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 examines NWB metadata and accesses LFP/acquisition and electrodes. It does not explicitly walk the NWB structure outside these elements. Notebook 2 not only extracts metadata but also demonstrates traversing various groups (acquisition, intervals, processing), and provides code for listing NWB files in the Dandiset. Its code structure offers a better survey of how the NWB file is organized (including processing modules for running and optotagging).

<question>4</question>
<question_shortened>Did visualizations help understand key data aspects?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks include informative visualizations: Notebook 1 plots LFP traces and electrode positions; Notebook 2 plots stimulus timing/durations, spike rasters, and running speed. The visualizations in Notebook 2 are more diverse and sample more data types (stimulus structure, neural response, behavior), whereas Notebook 1’s are restricted to LFPs and electrode locations. Notebook 2’s figures generally help a new user understand the types of information present more thoroughly.

<question>5</question>
<question_shortened>Did any visualizations hinder understanding?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks present clear, standard visualizations, with appropriate axes and labels. Notebook 1's LFP trace plot uses voltage units and channel offsets, which are standard and visually distinguishable. The electrode map uses good color coding. Notebook 2’s plots are generally straightforward; perhaps the running speed plot could use some smoothing, but it is still clear. No plots in either notebook are misleading or poorly formatted, so neither is disadvantaged here.

<question>6</question>
<question_shortened>Do you feel more confident making your own plots?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 provides a well-coded example of plotting LFP traces and electrode scatter plots, which are adaptable for similar data. Notebook 2 offers a wider variety of plotting templates (event intervals, spike rasters, behavioral data), making it easier to adapt to a range of modalities. This variety better supports confidence in generating new visualizations for this dataset.

<question>7</question>
<question_shortened>Did visualizations convey structure/complexity of data?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 shows basic structure of LFP and the spatial diversity of electrodes, but stops there. Notebook 2 visualizes not just raw signals (spikes, running speed) but also event structure (stimulus timing, optogenetic intervals), exposing more of the underlying experimental complexity and the relationship between data modalities.

<question>8</question>
<question_shortened>Were interpretations/conclusions well-supported?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks mainly focus on demonstrating data loading and basic visualization, with minimal interpretation. Neither notebook makes strong claims or unsupported conclusions. Thus, they are equivalent in this regard.

<question>9</question>
<question_shortened>Any unnecessarily redundant plots or examples?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook is notably redundant. Notebook 1 covers LFP and electrodes with unique plots; Notebook 2 features different aspects with each plot (stimulus, spikes, behavior). Both are concise in visualization variety.

<question>10</question>
<question_shortened>Does the notebook help with understanding possible next analyses?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks present “Next Steps” or “Suggested Analyses.” Notebook 1 lists classic analyses (temporal precision, response patterns, LFP by layer/electrode location), while Notebook 2’s suggestions are more tailored to this Dandiset’s features (spike timing precision, behavioral state, optogenetic effect, area comparisons), and includes links to online viewers and resources. This makes Notebook 2 slightly more helpful for envisioning concrete next analyses.

<question>11</question>
<question_shortened>How clear and easy was the notebook to follow?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks are logically organized with clear markdown and block separation. Notebook 2’s structure (introduction, table of contents, then stepwise blocks for each data type) arguably makes the scope more transparent from the start, though both are readable and annotated. The difference is small but, for a newcomer, Notebook 2’s stepwise/sectioned approach is a little more user-friendly, especially with the upfront outline of contents.

<question>12</question>
<question_shortened>Does notebook provide easily reusable/adaptable code?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 includes reusable code for accessing LFP and electrode data. Notebook 2 provides reusable templates for many core analyses (file listing, extracting intervals, spikes, behavioral series) on top of straightforward plotting. The code in Notebook 2 would be easier to repurpose for exploring more aspects of the dataset than Notebook 1.

<question_shortened>Does notebook help with next analysis questions?</question_shortened>

<question>14</question>
<question_shortened>Overall, how helpful was this notebook for getting started?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
While both notebooks are excellent for newcomers, Notebook 2 is more comprehensive, covering more types of data in the Dandiset, clearer in its stepwise exposition, and provides more reusable code and visualization examples. Notebook 1 is concise and focused, but limited in scope relative to the Dandiset’s full range. Thus, Notebook 2 is overall more helpful as a “getting started” resource.
