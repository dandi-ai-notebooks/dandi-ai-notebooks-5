<question_shortened>Clarity of Dandiset purpose/content</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 opens with a succinct overview and clearly breaks down the experiment and what will be covered in the notebook ("Explore the dandiset metadata…", etc). However, Notebook 2 spends more effort up front contextualizing the dataset, with bolded key points, specific mention of file types and content, and a separate section titled "What This Notebook Covers" that lays out objectives. Notebook 2’s breakdown (e.g., callouts about special notes like LFP timestamps being in ms) makes the purpose and unique characteristics of the dataset even more explicit and memorable. Both do a good job, but Notebook 2 is more comprehensive and user-centered in setting the stage.

<question_shortened>Confidence accessing different data types</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 mainly demonstrates LFP data access and electrode information, with minimal mention of spikes or behavioral/optogenetic data. Notebook 2, by contrast, shows how to access spikes (with spike raster and spike time code), stimulus tables, behavioral running, and optogenetic intervals, explaining and visualizing each. It also calls attention to data type organization (e.g., ogen vs. probe files) and explicitly calls out file-type differences in its summary. Someone following NB2 would have a much clearer roadmap for accessing all data types.

<question_shortened>Understanding NWB structure & how to use</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 provides a detailed look at electrode table, probe, and LFP structures, including DataFrames and group info—very helpful for LFP-centric work. However, Notebook 2 sets out to explain and demonstrate access to multiple NWB tables (units, intervals, behavioral series, opto blocks), prints out keys and modules, and even discusses “acquisition_timeseries”, “processing_modules,” etc. It gives a better overall road map of the NWB file’s complexity and subgroups. Notebook 2 is more comprehensive for a newcomer wanting to navigate the NWB organization.

<question>4</question>
<question_shortened>Helpfulness of notebook visualizations</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 has a larger total number of visualizations (e.g., dual electrode position plots, region barplots, LFP sample traces, LFP heatmap, spectrogram, etc). These are generally high-quality and helpful for exploring spatial and time/frequency patterns. Notebook 2, meanwhile, focuses on spikes (raster), stimulus interval precision, firing rate histogram, running behavior, and omits LFP plots. While Notebook 2’s plots are clear, Notebook 1’s breadth and variety better demonstrate the richness of the dataset’s structure, especially regarding spatial/neural organization. However, Notebook 2 has a more focused set of examples across data types. Overall, NB1 better supports exploration with its visualizations.

<question>5</question>
<question_shortened>Problems/ambiguity from visualizations?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks produce clear and standard visualizations with appropriate axes/titles. Neither has obvious axes issues, misleading displays, or formatting problems. If anything, Notebook 1 occasionally produces empty plots (for example, brain region-specific LFP plots), but this does not cause confusion for the casual reader, as the code logic is clear. Otherwise, plots are handled with standard conventions, and interpretation is not hindered. This is a tie; both are fine.

<question>6</question>
<question_shortened>Confidence for making own visualizations</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 provides a wider range of visualization types: from electrode geometry to barplots to LFP line plots, heatmaps, and spectrograms. These concrete, comprehensive plotting examples would give a new user many patterns to adapt. Notebook 2’s plots are fewer and focused on spikes, stimuli, and running; while useful, their diversity is less. Overall, Notebook 1 by virtue of its breadth would make most users feel more ready to create various kinds of figures from this dataset.

<question>7</question>
<question_shortened>Visualizations show data structure/complexity well?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 stands out: its pair of electrode coordinate plots (probe geometry/brain coordinates) and heatmap/spectrogram provide immediate intuition about both spatial/electrical and temporal/frequency structure. The LFP region barplot links anatomical coverage. Notebook 2’s spike raster and running-speed traces are helpful, but don’t expose the full complexity/scale of structure (e.g., spatial layout, frequency info, etc). Thus, NB1 is stronger on conveying structural/complexity properties via plotting.

<question>8</question>
<question_shortened>Interpretation/conclusions unclear or unsupported?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Most interpretations in both notebooks are well-linked to code and outputs. Notebook 1 has more commentary in outputs and markdown summarizing the findings from LFP, electrode, and anatomical exploration, though has a few failed plots (empty regional LFP plots) but addresses their logic in the code. Notebook 2 is more explanatory about what analyses might be possible and points out the context for future work. Both are sufficiently careful not to overclaim, and their interpretations are generally supported by shown results.

<question>9</question>
<question_shortened>Unnecessarily repetitive or redundant plots/examples?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook is particularly repetitive. Notebook 1’s only minor redundancy might be that it makes two attempts at region-wise LFP data, but these are methodologically distinct (averaging, then sample channel). Notebook 2 sometimes repeats checking unit spike information and stimulus structure in multiple forms, but not in a problematic way. All plotted/printed examples are sufficiently distinct and relevant to the topic, so there’s no strong case against either notebook for repetition.

<question_shortened>Guidance for next questions/analyses</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1, in its final summary, lists a few broad example questions/directions, but Notebook 2 provides a dedicated “Next Steps for Analysis” section with concrete analysis suggestions linked to the data types demonstrated (e.g., barcode analysis, response tuning, behavioral state segmentation, etc). This makes the user better equipped to formulate their next questions or pipelines.

<question_shortened>Clarity and ease of following notebook</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2 is extremely well-organized: it uses numbered sections, bolded lists for key points, and clearly labels code and outputs for each new concept. Notebook 1 covers a lot of ground, but its code/markdown sequence is a bit less structured, and some code/output blocks are long, which can overwhelm a new user. For beginners, the explicit roadmap structure and frequent recaps in Notebook 2 make it easier to follow.

<question_shortened>Ease of reusing or adapting code</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks offer reusable code snippets that can be directly adapted: iterating assets, loading NWB files remotely, DataFrame queries, spike access, etc. Notebook 2’s code for accessing units, intervals, and behavior is a bit more explicit and modular, and its step-by-step demos of unit selection, event alignment, and so forth would likely be easier to lift wholesale. NB1’s code is sometimes more extended and exploratory but similarly reusable. A slight edge to NB2 for modular clarity.

<rationale>
Notebook 1 summarizes follow-up ideas in a brief bullet list, whereas Notebook 2 explicitly spells out types of analyses possible (barcoding, response tuning, behavioral state stratification, multi-modal analysis). It calls out what was shown, and makes clear, actionable recommendations for research extensions. This guides users more clearly into planning next analyses.

<question_shortened>Overall helpfulness for getting started</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both are strong, but Notebook 2 is overall a better “getting started” resource for a wider set of Dandiset users: it is more comprehensive in demonstrating data types (spikes, stimulus, behavior, opto), is more structured, and gives clear code and conceptual roadmaps throughout. Notebook 1 excels in LFP exploration and is stronger for spatial structure and advanced/visual users, but NB2 is broader and more beginner-friendly for first engagement.
