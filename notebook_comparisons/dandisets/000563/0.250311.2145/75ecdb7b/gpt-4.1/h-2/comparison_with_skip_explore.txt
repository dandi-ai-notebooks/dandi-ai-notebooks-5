<question>1</question>
<question_shortened>Clarity of Dandiset purpose/content</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 opens with a crisp, structured overview of the Dandiset, explicitly listing key facts (species, data, format, stimulus) and summarizing the analysis steps ("This notebook demonstrates..."). The scope is narrow but focused on LFP/spike data and probe geometry. Notebook 2’s overview is more narrative, listing broader aims (LFP, spikes, behavior, stimulus, optogenetics, guidance), and more clearly connects to multiple modalities, but arguably with a less itemized presentation of Dandiset details. The explicit bullet points in Notebook 1 make it easier for a new user to quickly understand what’s inside the Dandiset, although Notebook 2 provides a broader perspective on potential analyses.

<question_shortened>Confidence in accessing the data types</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks provide code and an example list of NWB file assets, explicitly demonstrating how to enumerate them via the DANDI API. Notebook 2 goes a step further by explicitly showing how to select both LFP (ecephys) and ogen (multi-modal) files, helping users recognize different file types within the archive. It offers a helpful explanation of file naming conventions and explains why each type is chosen, making it easier for a user to understand how to access the full range of data. Notebook 1 shows asset enumeration but focuses analysis on just one ecephys file, potentially leaving newcomers less clear about how to access other data modalities.

<question>3</question>
<question_shortened>Understanding NWB structure/workflow</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 carefully inspects basic NWB file metadata, device and electrode group tables, and provides detail on channel geometry—thus building a stepwise understanding of NWB structure tied to this Dandiset (including inspection of the electrodes table with Pandas). Notebook 2, while showing how to use pynwb to access specific data (LFP, spikes, behavior), moves quickly to analysis and visualizations and does not present as comprehensive a check of NWB structure or metadata. For users needing to generalize the workflow, Notebook 1’s attention to file organization, metadata fields, and how to extract and interpret tables is superior.

<question>4</question>
<question_shortened>Value of visualizations for data understanding</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 includes: 3D electrode geometry visualization, and an LFP snippet visualization, both of which illuminate the structure and basic signals. Notebook 2 offers more diverse visualizations: a 10s LFP trace (time series), spike raster plot, pupil area time series, a DataFrame summary (unit quality metrics), and a stimulus event raster. These richer visualizations, covering multiple modalities, give a much fuller illustration of what the Dandiset enables, and offer stronger intuition for users about the scientific richness of the data.

<question>5</question>
<question_shortened>Problems with visualization clarity or formatting</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook contains major visualization formatting flaws. Notebook 1’s LFP time series plot is clear and standard, and the 3D probe plot is helpful. Notebook 2’s LFP and spike raster plots are clear; the pupil area and event raster plots also use appropriate axes/labels. There were no misleading or confusing plots in either notebook. If anything, Notebook 2’s broader set of visualizations makes it slightly harder to maintain absolute clarity, but in practice, all are adequately formatted and accessible.

<question>6</question>
<question_shortened>Confidence in creating own visualizations</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2 covers a wider range of data types, accesses them in canonical NWB ways (by group/hierarchy), and demonstrates good plotting patterns—LFP, spike rasters, behavioral series, and event rasters. This breadth, especially the diversity of example access patterns, would make most users more confident in plotting their own data than the more specialized focus of Notebook 1, which (beyond the 3D geometry) is limited to LFP plots.

<question>7</question>
<question_shortened>Quality of visualizations for structure/complexity</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2 excels here, showing not just the electrical recordings but also spike units, behavioral signals, and stimulus events—all in clear, distinct formats that reflect the multidimensional structure of the dataset. Notebook 1’s geometry plot helps show probe structure, but covers only LFPs from one file. Thus, understanding of the multi-modal, multi-level structure is much better developed in Notebook 2.

<question>8</question>
<question_shortened>Clarity/support for interpretations/conclusions</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook draws misleading interpretations or presents unsupported claims. They both steer clear of deep interpretation, instead describing what is shown or suggesting possible next steps. Notebook 2 is careful to note what the visualizations show and avoids over-interpretation. Similarly, Notebook 1’s narrative is cautious. Neither stands out as unclear or poorly supported.

<question_shortened>Repetition/redundancy in examples</question_shortened>

Both notebooks avoid unnecessary repetition. Notebook 1’s workflow is linear and concise; Notebook 2, though longer, covers distinct types of data in unique visualizations. There is no meaningful redundancy in either.

<question_shortened>Understanding next analysis/questions to pursue</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks’ conclusion sections suggest next steps and potential analyses. However, Notebook 2 gives a more specific menu of possibilities—overlaying signals, higher-dimensional analyses, and relates these to demonstrated visualizations. Notebook 1’s suggestions are more general and not anchored to concrete examples as directly. Thus, Notebook 2 better orients the reader to the breadth of possible analyses.

<question_shortened>Overall clarity/ease of following</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 is short, methodical, and well structured, avoiding jargon and making incremental steps explicit. Notebook 2 is longer and a bit more ambitious in scope, which could present challenge for complete beginners, but its sectioning, in-notebook comments, and explicit workflow (from overview, through data types, to multi-modal visualizations) remain clear. Still, for absolute ease of following, Notebook 1’s single-focus and stepwise approach edges out the more complex narrative of Notebook 2, especially for users brand new to NWB/DANDI.

<question>12</question>
<question_shortened>Reusability/adaptability of code</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks provide code cells that are clean and modular. However, Notebook 2 includes more patterns (several types of signal access) and demonstrates compositional workflows with the DANDI API, pynwb, and the underlying data format. That gives users a greater toolbox of re-usable code fragments. Notebook 1’s code—while clean—is narrower in scope.

<question_shortened>Understanding potential for further analysis</question_shortened>

(Note: This mostly duplicates Q10.) Again, Notebook 2 demonstrates and explicitly lists a wider set of candidate analyses (neural-behavioral overlays, multi-unit summaries, cross-modality work), better scaffolding for readers to launch their own next steps.

<question_shortened>Overall helpfulness for getting started</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 is methodical and great for an incremental, metadata-to-data, probe-centric intro focused on LFPs and probe geometry. However, Notebook 2, by spanning both LFP and multi-modal data (spikes, behavior, stimuli), and by showing more diverse access/visualization recipes, will be much more helpful for most new users who aim to work broadly with this rich dataset. The wider coverage and more practical demonstrations win out for “getting started” in a general-use sense.
