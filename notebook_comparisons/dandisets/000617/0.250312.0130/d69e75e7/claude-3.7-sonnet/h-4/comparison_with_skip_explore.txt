<question_shortened>Understanding Dandiset purpose/content</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 gives a highly detailed overview of the Dandiset, including background literature, the nuances of the experimental design, and key biological questions. It offers multiple prose sections and clear bullet points outlining both what the Dandiset contains and what the notebook will cover. Notebook 2 provides a concise summary of the project, focuses quickly on its sequence learning aspect, and offers a succinct list of experimental features. However, Notebook 1 helps users better understand the context, goals, and breadth of the Dandiset by providing more background and explanation.

<question_shortened>Confidence in data access</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 explicitly demonstrates access to nearly every major type of data (metadata, NWB file/s, calcium imaging, eye tracking, running speed, stimulus events, etc.), with individual code blocks and explanations for each, making it easy for someone new to the data to see a clear entry point for each type. Notebook 2 covers similar ground, but behavioral (e.g. eye) data is neglected (only running and event detection shown) and the code is sometimes more abbreviated. Notebook 1 gives more confidence in navigating/accessing all the key data types.

<question_shortened>Understanding NWB file structure</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks clearly cover the NWB file structure, but Notebook 1 is more systematic: it prints all modules, describes acquisition/processing/intervals in the NWB, and explores their contents hierarchically. Notebook 2 gives a very solid summary of high-level file structure and explores some module contents, but provides less step-by-step evidence for the file organization and structure. Notebook 1 is more thorough.

<question_shortened>Helpful visualizations of key data</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks provide clear, useful visualizations, including calcium trace plots, stimulus timelines, and running speed. However, Notebook 1 offers a wider range of visualizations (ROI scatter, heatmaps, correlation histograms, eye tracking plots, field-of-view projections, etc.). These more thoroughly illustrate the data’s complexity and key features. Notebook 2’s figures are for the most part clear but less comprehensive. The first notebook's visuals support understanding more aspects of the data.

<question>5</question>
<question_shortened>Visualization clarity/problems</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks generally produce clear, helpful visualizations. There are small issues in each: Notebook 1’s ROI scatter has a colorbar that’s not fully meaningful (since all ROIs are valid), and a later set of stimulus-aligned average response plots display flat lines (possibly due to a bug or mismatch in data slicing). Notebook 2's ROI overlay has spatial alignment issues (acknowledged in text), but these are typical for this kind of data. Overall, neither notebook had major misleading or confusing plots, but Notebook 1's stimulus-aligned response plots may mislead due to apparent errors while Notebook 2 better prepares the user for visual caveats.

<question>6</question>
<question_shortened>Confidence to create visualizations</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 offers a wider range of plotting examples, including more complex visualizations (heatmaps, trial-averaged plots, detailed correlation analyses, overlays, etc.), along with data transformation steps before visualizing. This breadth gives more inspiration and reference for users wanting to generate their own plots. Notebook 2 covers the basics (ROI overlays, activity/running, stimulus plotting) but does not go as far. Notebook 1 better prepares users to create a wide variety of visualizations.

<question>7</question>
<question_shortened>Visualization shows data structure/complexity</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 visualizes a broader spectrum of data: from neuron locations and field-of-view images, to behavioral correlates and distributions of neural-behavioral correlations. This helps show the richness and multidimensionality of the dataset. Notebook 2 focuses more on a few modalities (ROI, dF/F, stimulus, running), but does not address relationships and distributions as thoroughly. Notebook 1’s visualizations make the complexity and structure of the dataset clearer.

<question>8</question>
<question_shortened>Are interpretations/conclusions clear/supported?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks largely avoid over-interpretation, focusing on data exploration. Notebook 1 provides suggested analyses and remarks on the meaning of certain results (e.g. relating dF/F to running, interpreting population response plots). However, its flat-line plot (stimulus-aligned average response) is potentially misleading, which could confuse some users. Notebook 2’s interpretations are more cautious and match the data shown, acknowledging limitations in ROI overlays, for example. On balance, Notebook 2 avoids confusion and unsupported conclusions a bit better.

<question>9</question>
<question_shortened>Repetitive/redundant plots/examples</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook feels especially repetitive—both move through the major data types and visualization examples without undue duplication. If anything, Notebook 1 risks a bit of redundancy with multiple similar visualizations of dF/F traces and behavior, but this is justified by the context and is useful for user understanding. Notebook 2, being more concise, is if anything too brief rather than repetitive. The differences are minor.

<rationale>
Both notebooks end by suggesting further questions/analyses and highlight next steps. Notebook 1 provides a richer set of concrete ideas at several points: population analysis, cross-session comparisons, decoding, etc. Notebook 2 mentions general next steps (align to stimuli, compare responses, population analysis), but the suggestions in Notebook 1 are more varied and actionable.

<question>11</question>
<question_shortened>Clarity/ease of following</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2 is slightly more concise, its code blocks are generally well isolated, and its markdown is more direct, which may make it easier for beginners to follow. Notebook 1 is comprehensive but sometimes verbose and, in a few places, the longer output streams and plot code may obscure the narrative. However, both are well structured, with clear sectioning and explanations throughout. The difference is minor, but Notebook 2’s brevity may aid clarity for a new user.

<question_shortened>Reusability/adaptability of code</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks expose practical, reusable code for accessing, plotting, and manipulating key data. Notebook 1 provides more examples (especially for advanced users interested in cross-modal analysis or trial structure), whereas Notebook 2’s code is slightly easier to copy/adapt at entry level due to brevity. For most users, the two serve as equally useful starting points, depending on their needs.

<question_shortened>Overall helpfulness for getting started</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 stands out for its comprehensiveness and breadth—users learn about the Dandiset, its biological context, practical methods for accessing all key data, and example analyses that span structure, function, and behavior. Some minor issues (stimulus response plot flatness, verbosity) detract, but for someone wanting a deeper starter guide, it is more helpful than Notebook 2. Notebook 2, meanwhile, is concise and clear, but covers fewer facets in depth.
