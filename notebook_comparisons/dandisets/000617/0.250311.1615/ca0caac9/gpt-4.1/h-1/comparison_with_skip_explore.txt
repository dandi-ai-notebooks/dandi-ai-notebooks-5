<question>1</question>
<question_shortened>Understanding purpose/content of the Dandiset</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks introduce Dandiset 000617 and mention that it contains two-photon calcium imaging and behavioral data related to sequence learning. Notebook 1 has an explicit overview cell summarizing the scientific themes (predictive coding, neuronal population dynamics, response to visual stimuli), and links directly to the Dandiset landing page. Notebook 2 also provides an overview, but its descriptions are slightly more general, focusing on what is in the file but not the scientific context. Overall, Notebook 1 is slightly stronger in situating the dataset within a neuroscience context and giving a purpose for its use.

<question>2</question>
<question_shortened>Confidence accessing different types of data</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks show how to list assets in the Dandiset, select a file, obtain a download link, and load NWB files remotely. However, Notebook 2 offers a broader demonstration of accessing different data types: two-photon frames, ROI masks, dF/F, running speed, stimulus intervals, and eye tracking—all from a single session. Notebook 1 covers calcium imaging, running, and stimulus intervals, but omits examples for imaging frames, ROI segmentation, or eye tracking data access. Thus, Notebook 2 fosters greater confidence in accessing the full variety of data types for this Dandiset.

<question>3</question>
<question_shortened>Understanding NWB file structure and use</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2 is generally superior for this criterion—it demonstrates how to access a broader range of data structures (including acquisition, processing modules, spatial ROIs, image masks), which illuminates the NWB hierarchy and the organization of the experiment's outputs. Notebook 1 focuses more narrowly on a few processing modules, mainly ophys and running, with less exploration of the file's organizational depth. Therefore, those wanting to understand NWB structure as it relates to this Dandiset will benefit more from Notebook 2.

<question>4</question>
<question_shortened>Did visualizations help understanding?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 includes visualizations of dF/F for 5 cells, running speed, and a stimulus interval timeline for multiple types (with careful distinction between movies and gray). Notebook 2 offers a wider variety: motion-corrected image, dF/F (for 10 cells), ROI masks overlaid on an average image, running speed, stimulus intervals (for movie_clip_A), and pupil area (eye tracking). The inclusion of ROI and imaging frame visualizations adds significant intuitive value, especially for new users. Therefore, although both notebooks' plots are clear, Notebook 2 provides a more helpful and comprehensive set of visualizations.

<question>5</question>
<question_shortened>Were any visualizations confusing or misleading?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook included outright confusing or misleading visualizations. Axes are generally labeled, and color/overlay choices seem reasonable. There are minor, non-blocking issues: Notebook 1 offsets traces for visibility (which helps but isn't strictly necessary), whereas Notebook 2 overlays unscaled dF/F (thus traces overlap more). Notebook 2's mask overlay is busy but not misleading. However, no visualization seems to actively hinder understanding. Differences are minor.

<question>6</question>
<question_shortened>Confidence to create own visualizations</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2 more clearly demonstrates varied types of visualizations (imaging frame, segmentation mask overlay, trace plots, behavioral readout) and often shows how to adapt axes, colors, and overlays. This breadth better equips a reader to adapt code for their own visualizations. Notebook 1's visualizations are more limited in variety. Thus, Notebook 2 inspires more confidence for readers wanting to extend to their own analyses.

<question>7</question>
<question_shortened>Did visualizations show data structure/complexity?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2 excels here, with examples that directly show: raw frames, image masks, running, dF/F, eye tracking, and stimulus timing—thus exposing the multi-modal, multi-layer structure of the NWB. Notebook 1, by omitting segmentations and eye tracking, is less illustrative of the data's overall complexity. Notebook 2's ROI overlays and frame visualizations provide strong visual cues about data richness.

<question>8</question>
<question_shortened>Interpretations or conclusions unclear or unsupported?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook over-interprets or makes strong conclusions—their tone is exploratory and code-focused. Both warn the reader to validate results before drawing scientific conclusions, as the notebooks are AI-generated. No interpretations presented feel unsupported by the shown data. Thus, there is no significant difference here.

<question>9</question>
<question_shortened>Were there redundant/repetitive plots or code?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook is particularly redundant. Both move through different data types in a straightforward manner. Notebook 2 does reuse similar plotting code styles, but for different data modalities each time. Notebook 1's structure is similarly disciplined, with each plot visualizing a new aspect. Thus, they are on par for this criterion.

<question>10</question>
<question_shortened>Did notebook suggest what you could do next?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 concludes with a numbered "extend this framework" section, explicitly suggesting potential analyses (e.g., compare activity across conditions, analyze event detection, co-register with running or eye tracking). Notebook 2 summarizes the modalities explored and encourages further exploration, but with less explicit guidance about next analyses—though it closes by encouraging adaptation to one's own questions. Overall, Notebook 1 slightly better scaffolds next steps and analysis ideas, though Notebook 2 is not bad.

<question>11</question>
<question_shortened>How clear and easy to follow?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks are logically structured, with direct prose introducing each code block, and maintain a step-by-step exploratory flow. Notebook 1 uses explicit section numbers, which can help navigation, while Notebook 2 provides descriptive headers for each section. Notebook 2's explanatory text is marginally denser but clear. Overall, both are easy to follow; any difference is minor.

<question>12</question>
<question_shortened>Code reusability/adaptability</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks include well-commented and modular code that could be adapted for other sessions or files. Both show how to list files, access assets, and plot. However, Notebook 2 includes several reusable code snippets for more modalities, e.g., imaging frame, eye tracking, ROI masks. This breadth slightly increases the utility of its code for those wanting to explore further.

<question>13</question>
<question_shortened>Did notebook help you understand next steps/analyses?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
This is similar to question 10. Notebook 1 gives an explicit list under "You can extend this framework to", spelling out types of analyses and further directions a user could take, including population analyses, behavioral alignment, and co-registration. Notebook 2 encourages adaptation for user-specific questions but is less explicit. Thus, Notebook 1 is stronger in scaffolding next steps.

<question>14</question>
<question_shortened>Overall helpfulness for getting started</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2 provides a broader introduction to the modalities in the file, with code for motion-corrected frames, ROI masks, trace plots, running, stimulus, and eye tracking. These examples, coupled with stepwise explanations, make it more informative for a user wanting to understand the richness of the Dandiset and get started with custom exploration. Notebook 1 is clear, but less extensive in showing the full data variety. Thus, Notebook 2 is overall the more helpful starting point.
