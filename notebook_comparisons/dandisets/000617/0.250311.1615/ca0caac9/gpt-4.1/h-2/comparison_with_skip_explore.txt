<question_shortened>Understanding purpose/content of Dandiset</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 provides an in-depth project overview, bullet-pointed experiment details, and clear context on the modalities present in the Dandiset right at the start. It summarizes experimental aims, species, sample size, methodology, areas/layers, and refers users directly to the detailed Dandiset record. Notebook 2 offers a solid introduction, but while its summary is concise, some specific experimental details (e.g., genotype, brain areas, sample size) are less exhaustively itemized. Both include Dandiset links and context, but Notebook 1 gives a better, more structured, “at a glance” scientific summary for unfamiliar users.

<question>2</question>
<question_shortened>Confidence accessing Dandiset data</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks demonstrate how to access data using the DANDI API and how to select a sample NWB file for exploration. However, Notebook 1 walks through asset listing for a specific subject and clarifies the file naming convention, which makes it easier for new users to orient themselves in the dataset. Notebook 2 is efficient but omits explanation of file naming; its code is less detailed in helping a user discover different asset types. Overall, Notebook 1 better supports user confidence in navigating and understanding the collection of files.

<question_shortened>Understanding NWB file structure/workflow</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 explicitly inspects and prints NWB session metadata, details subject/genotype fields, and provides step-by-step exploration of various NWB modules (ophys, intervals, behavioral interfaces, etc.) in a way that builds user understanding of NWB structure relevant to this experiment. Notebook 2 demonstrates how to open NWB with Pynwb and access data groups, but spends less effort explaining structure—users see code that “does the thing” but may not connect the logical NWB organization to the data they are exploring. Notebook 1’s approach is better for learning and interpretation.

<question>4</question>
<question_shortened>Visualization aids understanding</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks offer a variety of relevant visualizations: imaging frames, traces, masks, running speed, stimuli, and eye data. Notebook 1 tends to contextualize each plot more (e.g., with axis labels, clear units, multiple supporting panels such as masks and statistics, and legends). It goes further, showing distributions and ROI summary stats, and provides code for more panels per topic, aiding interpretation. Notebook 2 is technically competent, but tends to present a single exemplar visual per data type, sometimes with less contextual explanation. Thus, Notebook 1’s visualizations generally add more value to data comprehension.

<question>5</question>
<question_shortened>Poor visualizations/formatting?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook contains genuinely misleading or confusing visualizations. However, some of Notebook 2’s plots (especially the ROI overlays and the stimulus raster) could be hard to decipher for users unfamiliar with the experiment, due to brief captions or axis suppression. In contrast, Notebook 1 provides more annotation, legends, and explanation, reducing ambiguity. Still, both are generally clear, with only minor weaknesses; the difference here is small, but Notebook 1 is a bit stronger in formatting/context.

<question>6</question>
<question_shortened>Confidence creating own visualizations</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 covers more data modalities, provides well-commented code, and includes several views for each type of signal (e.g., summary stats, distributions, mask displays, and multiple panels). It feels more like a practical template a user can extend for their own explorations, whereas Notebook 2 presents competent but sometimes less pedagogically motivated code (one figure per type). Notebook 1 is thus likely to leave readers more confident in adapting code for custom figures/analyses.

<question>7</question>
<question_shortened>Visualizing structure/complexity of data</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 provides explicit visualizations of the complexity of the data (e.g., histograms of ROI sizes, scatter of ROI locations, full-field mask overlay, distribution plots for stimulus timing and behavior) and highlights the diversity and organization of both neural and behavioral data streams. Notebook 2’s visuals mostly offer single examples per modality, which does less to convey the scale and richness of the dataset. Notebook 1 thus better demonstrates the multidimensional structure and experimental design.

<question>8</question>
<question_shortened>Interpretations/conclusions clarity</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook attempts strong statistical inference or claim conclusions from the plots; both largely stay descriptive. However, Notebook 1’s running commentary provides context and rationale for each section’s visualizations and what they reveal; instructions are closely tied to data shown. Notebook 2’s narrative is more terse, leaving some panels without interpretive text or guidance (outside short code comments). Notebook 1 is slightly clearer and more informative, though both avoid unsupported conclusions.

<question>9</question>
<question_shortened>Redundancy/repetitiveness in plots</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook is burdened by excessive repetition, but Notebook 1 does show several alternative views of some data (multiple plots of ROI geometry, masks, traces). This adds redundancy only in service of discovery/sensemaking. Notebook 2 is streamlined, but could feel sparse if a user is looking to see alternative perspectives on data. Neither is “unnecessarily repetitive,” but Notebook 1’s approach might feel a little more drawn out. Still, this is a minor difference.

<question>10</question>
<question_shortened>Understanding next steps/analysis directions</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 includes a dedicated section listing concrete “next steps and further exploration” (response alignment, comparison across conditions, reliability, sequence learning across sessions, etc.). This scaffolds new users’ thinking on what they can do now that they’re oriented in the data. Notebook 2’s conclusion is more general/summative, without such a list of suggested analyses or next steps. Notebook 1 is therefore more helpful for users wanting research inspiration.

<question_shortened>Clarity and ease of following the notebook</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 is broken into clear, numbered sections, each with markdown summaries, comments, and rationale text. It proceeds in a logical, pedagogical order from summary to API connection, exploration, structure, and mapping modalities, and is interspersed with clear output comments and figures. Notebook 2 is also logically ordered and comprehensible, but omits some intermediary explanations and might be harder for total beginners. The differences are moderate but real.

<question>12</question>
<question_shortened>Code reusability/adaptability</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks provide runnable code blocks, but Notebook 1’s code is generally more modular, well-commented, and explicit in illustrating how to access, analyze, and visualize multiple data types. Its emphasis on pandas DataFrames for ROI tables and explicit file naming logic also aid adaptation. Notebook 2’s code is clear, but more focused on “getting the plot” rather than robust, general exploration, and has less commentary on why certain steps or groupings are used. Most users would find Notebook 1’s code easier to copy and repurpose.

<question>13</question>
<question_shortened>Understanding possible analyses/questions</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Overlap with question 10: Notebook 1 lists several analytical directions explicitly, while Notebook 2 provides only a general suggestion that one can "align responses," etc., but without examples. Repeating rationale from above: Notebook 1 actively scaffolds users toward likely analyses, aiding experiment design.

<question_shortened>Overall helpfulness getting started</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Summing across all criteria, Notebook 1 leads users through the process with more explicit explanations, richer visual and code examples, and guidance for continuing analysis. Its stepwise, annotated, and well-labeled approach makes it more helpful as both a template and a learning resource for new users of this Dandiset and similar multimodal NWB datasets. Notebook 2 is efficient and competent, but less informative for absolute beginners or those wanting to deeply understand scientific and technical context.
