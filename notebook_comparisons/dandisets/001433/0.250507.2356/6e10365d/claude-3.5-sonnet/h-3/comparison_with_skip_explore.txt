<question_shortened>Dandiset purpose/content clarity</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 starts with a concise overview that highlights the types of data (behavioral, LFP, breathing) and indicates the aim is to demonstrate how to access, load, and explore these signals. However, it is brief and does not provide organism or session details. Notebook 2 gives a richer overview, summarizing species, number of subjects, data types, format, and a breakdown of what the notebook covers. It also goes further to state the dataset contains video, though it is not used later, and specifically mentions the absence of tasks or stimuli. The explicit breakdown of coverage and content gives a clearer immediate understanding.

<question_shortened>Confidence in data access</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks guide the user through accessing the Dandiset using DandiAPIClient, and both demonstrate how to get URLs and load NWB files remotely. However, Notebook 2 goes further by programmatically listing all available files, providing a per-subject session count, and displaying a DataFrame summary of available files, size, and other metadata. This makes it clearer for a new user how to select a session/file. Notebook 1 shows only how to access a single pre-determined file, not how to systematically explore the choices.

<question>3</question>
<question_shortened>NWB file structure understanding</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 describes the NWB file as containing LFP, sniffing, and breathing event data, and provides examples accessing them by key. Notebook 2 includes similar code but supplements it with a markdown section called “Summary of Data Access Methods” that collects the key code snippets for LFP, sniff signal, breathing events, and electrode information, increasing learnability. Notebook 2 also more explicitly showcases electrode and session metadata via DataFrames. Both demonstrate working with NWB data structures but Notebook 2’s summary and added metadata exploration are a clear improvement.

<question>4</question>
<question_shortened>Usefulness of visualizations</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 visualizes one channel of LFP and the sniff signal for a short window, and it plots breathing intervals. Notebook 2 creates a multi-channel LFP plot with channel offsets and overlays inhalation/exhalation event markers on the sniffing trace for a comprehensive view, further distinguishing the event timing, and also computes and prints breathing interval summary statistics. Notebook 2’s dual-event overlays and multi-channel LFP are more informative for visualizing the data’s scope, structure, and event alignment.

<question>5</question>
<question_shortened>Visualization clarity or confusion</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks' visualizations are generally clear. Notebook 1’s plots are in standard formats (histogram, two traces). For Notebook 2, while the overlaid multi-channel LFP is dense, it uses channel offsets, which helps, and legend/axes are present. The event markers on the sniff trace are a little visually busy early in the window, but overall enhance comprehension rather than confuse. Neither notebook contains misleading visuals or unclear axes, though Notebook 2’s LFP subplot is more complex. Neither significantly impedes understanding.

<question>6</question>
<question_shortened>Confidence to create visualizations</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 presents basic but functional plotting for single-channel LFP and breathing signals. Notebook 2’s use of multi-dimensional plotting (offset for channel stacking, event overlays) and explicit snippet summaries in markdown provides a better reference and starting point for a user wanting to adapt or create new visualizations. Therefore, Notebook 2 does a better job at preparing the user for independent plotting.

<question>7</question>
<question_shortened>Visualization of data complexity/structure</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 limits its LFP analysis to a single channel and provides an aggregate breathing interval histogram. Notebook 2 visualizes all LFP channels simultaneously, which immediately illustrates the structure and complexity of the multi-channel signals, and overlays both inhalation and exhalation events. It also shows a DataFrame of electrode/session organization and includes summary statistics that further demonstrate the dataset structure.

<question>8</question>
<question_shortened>Interpretation clarity/support by data</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook ventures deeply into interpretation or strong scientific conclusions; both mostly stick to description. Notebook 1, under “Next Steps,” is cautious and aspirational. Notebook 2 is similarly reserved. However, Notebook 2’s “Analyzing Breathing Events” output hints at a statistical summary, which is reproducibly supported by the code and data. Both are modest and data-driven, with no overreach.

<question>9</question>
<question_shortened>Redundancy/repetitiveness</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook is unnecessarily repetitive. Each plot provides a unique view (LFP, sniffing, breathing intervals, summaries). Both avoid redundant plotting. Notebook 2 is somewhat more comprehensive, but this manifests as depth rather than repetition.

<question_shortened>Understanding possible next analyses</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks outline possible next steps and analyses, such as relationships between LFP and breathing, spatial/temporal analysis, and comparisons across sessions/subjects. Notebook 2 adds points about temporal alignment, quality control, cross-frequency coupling, and population analyses, which provides a broader field of inspiration for further work. This more detailed guidance is an advantage.

<question>11</question>
<question_shortened>Clarity and ease of following</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both are reasonably clear and stepwise, with markdown interleaved. Notebook 2’s greater metadata inspection, code summaries, and explicit statements of what each cell is achieving (e.g., file organization, summary code cell in markdown) make it slightly easier for a new user to follow, as there is more context at each stage. The main limitation is a denser code block for multi-channel plotting, yet this doesn’t substantially detract from clarity.

<question>12</question>
<question_shortened>Code reusability/adaptability</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks provide reusable code for loading data, plotting, accessing breathing signals, and so forth. However, Notebook 2’s explicit “Summary of Data Access Methods” cell collects these snippets and makes it very easy to copy/adapt code for further exploration. The dataset file listing and DataFrame summaries also provide a helpful template for users working across sessions or subjects.

<question_shortened>Understanding possible analyses</question_shortened>

This question overlaps with Question 10. Both notebooks suggest avenues for future research. Notebook 2 lists more diverse analysis options and gives extra thought to cross-subject and cross-frequency investigations, whereas Notebook 1 gives a more basic set of directions.

<question_shortened>Overall helpfulness for getting started</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 2 is more comprehensive, offers more context and summaries, better demonstrates file/session handling, and is otherwise a superset of Notebook 1’s guidance (with the exception of breathing interval histogram, which is only in Notebook 1 but is a minor omission). It is therefore a significantly stronger starting resource for a new user.
