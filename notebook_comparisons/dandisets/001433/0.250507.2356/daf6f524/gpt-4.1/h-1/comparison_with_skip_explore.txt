<question>1</question>
<question_shortened>Understanding Dandiset purpose and content</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks begin with an introduction and overview of Dandiset 001433, providing context and basic details (e.g., data modalities, species, experiment focus). Notebook 1 presents a longer, more structured overview (listing its aims and dataset features as bullet points and making explicit reference to what the notebook will do), while Notebook 2 provides a concisely written overview. However, Notebook 1 explicitly connects each step to the content and purpose of the dataset, such as the focus on LFP and sniffing, and lays out the notebook's goals for the user. Notebook 2 goes a little further in providing specifics (e.g., mentions number of animals), but has a less explicit roadmap for the workflow. Both make the dataset's content and intent clear, but Notebook 1 provides a more user-focused introduction and sets expectations for exploration.

<question_shortened>Confidence in accessing different data types</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 explicitly walks the user through listing, selecting, and loading NWB files, showing the process for both LFP and sniffing signals, and then event times. It demonstrates use of the DANDI API and NWB objects step-by-step (globbing, choosing subject and session, etc.). Notebook 2 demonstrates similar code for listing NWB files and loading one session, but is somewhat less explicit in the distinction between data types beyond focusing on one session file. Notebook 1 provides more detail, including distinctions between electrode, LFP, and sniff modalities and exactly how to access each, even giving a DataFrame example for electrodes; Notebook 2 focuses more on showing example code for one session. Overall, Notebook 1 provides more confidence to a new user in how to access each data type.

<question>3</question>
<question_shortened>Understanding NWB file structure and usage</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 emphasizes exploring NWB file organization—not just data loading and plotting. It retrieves and displays the session and subject metadata, creates a DataFrame of the electrode table, and shows how to access the processing module for behavioral events. Notebook 2 includes a summary cell describing the NWB file structure, but spends less time delving into file structure through code or output (no explicit metadata or electrode table exploration). Therefore, Notebook 1 offers more in helping users grasp the underlying structure and how to navigate it programmatically.

<question>4</question>
<question_shortened>Helpfulness of visualizations for data understanding</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks provide clear and useful plots of LFP and sniff signals, along with events. Notebook 1 stands out by showing multiple approaches: a multi-channel LFP line plot, a heatmap across all channels, sniff trace with inhalation/exhalation overlay, and encourages extending with further analyses. Notebook 2 plots only a single LFP channel, sniff trace, and overlays event lines. The range and types of visualizations in Notebook 1 give a significantly broader sense of the data's structure and temporal relationships, which is highly instructive for new users.

<question>5</question>
<question_shortened>Did visualizations make data harder to understand?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
No major visualizations in either notebook are actively misleading or poorly formatted. All axes are labeled, and time windows are clear. However, some minor issues: Notebook 2 overlays inhalation/exhalation with many vertical lines (could be visually busy), but uses dashed/dotted distinctions. Notebook 1's plots are more separated and in some ways, clearer (e.g., color coding, legend use). Both are clear, but Notebook 1's heatmap and offset line-plots may be more readable for multichannel data. Neither has an outright problem, so the difference is minor, but Notebook 1 is slightly better.

<question>6</question>
<question_shortened>Confidence in making own visualizations</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks provide visualization examples with code that can be adapted, but Notebook 1 displays a wider range, showing both line and heatmap modalities, and how to access and visualize multiple channels at once. This richer set of approaches boosts the user's confidence in adapting or extending visualizations. Notebook 2's scope is narrower (single LFP channel). Both have reusable code, but Notebook 1's diversity is more empowering for the user.

<question>7</question>
<question_shortened>Visualizations showing structure/complexity of data</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 does a better job illustrating the complexity and structure of the data by visualizing all 16 electrodes via a heatmap and multiple line plots, and displaying metadata tables. Notebook 2 focuses on a single LFP channel and does not show the multichannel aspect of the data as clearly. Thus, Notebook 1 better conveys the scale, organization, and structure present in the dataset.

<question>8</question>
<question_shortened>Were interpretations well supported?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook makes strong interpretations or biological claims. Both act as introductions and data exploration guides, not drawing firm conclusions from the data; instead, both suggest extensions or next steps. Therefore, neither gives unsupported interpretations: they're both careful and neutral.

<question>9</question>
<question_shortened>Were plots/examples redundant?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
No, neither notebook contains redundant plots or unnecessarily repetitive code. Notebook 1 presents different views (offset lines for multiple channels, heatmap, event overlays), and Notebook 2 provides one example of each modality. If anything, Notebook 1 could be slightly more verbose, but the variety is justified. Both are well-balanced in this regard.

<question_shortened>Helpfulness regarding next analysis steps</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 explicitly lists ("You can extend this exploration by: ...") possible analysis directions—spectral, comparative, and phase-based—in its summary and encourages the user to consult other resources for more. Notebook 2 also mentions possibilities in its final section, but is less detailed and less directed. Notebook 1 better seeds ideas for further exploration specific to the dataset.

<question_shortened>Clarity and ease of following the notebook</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks are clear and well-organized. Notebook 1 uses numbered section headings, step-by-step workflow, and descriptive markdown preambles. Notebook 2 has a more narrative, compact style but is also sequentially organized. Notebook 1 has a slight advantage in clarity due to its explicit numbering, careful explanations before each code block, and user-friendly summaries before and after sections.

<question>12</question>
<question_shortened>Code reuse/adaptability</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks provide executable code with minor adaptation (e.g., adjusting subject or session) for reuse. Notebook 1 more explicitly shows how to iterate over subjects and sessions, access metadata tables, and manipulate NWB structures as DataFrames, offering more "copy-paste" adaptability for diverse user needs. Notebook 2's code is similarly direct but slightly less general or modular. So, Notebook 1 is mildly better here.

<question>13</question>
<question_shortened>Understanding next analysis questions possible</question_shortened>
<rationale>
(This appears duplicated with Q10.)
Both notebooks suggest further analyses (spectral, event-aligned analysis, multi-subject comparisons), but Notebook 1 outlines these next steps with explicit bullet points and context. It also directly relates these to the data content (e.g., "Comparing sniff rhythms across sessions or animals"). Notebook 2 is a bit more vague here. Thus, Notebook 1 is better at pointing users forward.

<question>14</question>
<question_shortened>Overall helpfulness for getting started</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Overall, Notebook 1 is more comprehensive, better structured, and much more beginner friendly. It guides the user at each step—not just with code, but also rationale, output inspection, and ideas for further work—making it an ideal "getting started" resource. Notebook 2 is usable and covers the basic workflow, but is less thorough, especially regarding exploration of file structure, range of data types, and visualization breadth. Notebook 1 sets a positive standard for reproducible and instructive DANDI introductory notebooks.
