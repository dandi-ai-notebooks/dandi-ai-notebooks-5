          "description": "In the \"Detected Event Traces (first 1000 frames, 6 ROIs, vertically offset)\" plot, the first 1000 time points are plotted, but the x-axis starts at around 20s. This is likely because event_timestamps does not start at 0, which may confuse users expecting data from the session start. Adding further explanation, or truncating to exclude the time offset, would improve clarity.",
