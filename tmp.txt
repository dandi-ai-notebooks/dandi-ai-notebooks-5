<question_shortened>Helpfulness in understanding the Dandiset's purpose and content</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 provides a detailed overview (both textual and as a bullet list) describing the unique aspects of the Dandiset (e.g., multi-region neuropixels data, barcoded stimuli, optogenetics, behavioral/eye tracking, available metadata). Notebook 2 also gives a good intro, focusing on large-scale extracellular recordings, the scientific focus ("barcodes", neural coding, etc.), and what analyses are possible. However, Notebook 1 gives a more specific enumeration of the actual dataset content, making it easier to grasp at a glance what is available. Both link to the Dandiset page.

<question_shortened>Confidence in accessing different types of data</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 walks the user through accessing LFP, spike times, pupil area, stimulus events, and unit properties, showing clear step-by-step code for each—with explanations. This gives confidence that you can access the full range of data. Notebook 2 focuses exclusively on one NWB file (with LFP), inspects metadata, and only lightly touches on the types available. While clear for LFP, it doesn't guide accessing e.g. spike or behavioral data. Thus, Notebook 1 better builds confidence in accessing different data types.

<question_shortened>Understanding NWB file structure/usage</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 exposes users to multiple types of NWB data (acquisition, processing, units, behavioral, etc.) by example, in a way that demonstrates how NWB organizes data and how to find and extract them. It makes the NWB structure more tangible. Notebook 2 covers loading the file, prints high-level metadata, and inspects electrodes, but only for the LFP acquisition object; there is less exposure to broader NWB concepts like epochs or processing modules. Thus, Notebook 1 offers a broader understanding of NWB file structure.

<question_shortened>Visualizations helping understand data aspects</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 offers a variety of plots (LFP, spike raster, pupil area, stimulus raster, unit stats), each targeting a key dataset modality, showing not just signals but also providing context/summary (e.g., spike raster, table stats, tick plots for stimulus times). These visualizations are directly relevant to the data's complexity. Notebook 2 visualizes probe geometry and multiple LFP traces, aiding spatial and signal understanding, but doesn't cover neural or behavioral data modalities as thoroughly. Notebook 1 therefore provides more helpful, multifaceted visualizations.

<question>5</question>
<question_shortened>Any visualizations that make things harder to understand?</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Both notebooks generally provide clear, well-labeled plots. In Notebook 1, axes and plot labels are informative, and windows are appropriately zoomed (e.g., stimulus raster, spike raster). In Notebook 2, the probe geometry is a nice touch, and LFP offsets are clearly explained. There are no visualizations in either notebook that actively confuse or hinder understanding, although Notebook 2's probe geometry plot may require spatial neuroanatomical context for some users, but it's not misleading.

<question_shortened>Confidence in creating new visualizations</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 provides diverse visualization examples (different types of signals and modalities, summary tables, etc.), with reusable, segmented code, which better prepares the user to adapt or create new visualizations in the future. Notebook 2 provides good code for LFP and probe geometry, but lacks diversity in what types (and levels) of data are visualized, giving less of a foundation for inspiration or reuse in new settings.

<question_shortened>Visualizations capture structure/complexity of data</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 does a better job showing the variety and richness of the dataset: neural events, continuous signals, behavioral metrics, and summary statistics. This illustrates the dataset's complexity and structure. Notebook 2 covers probe/channel geometry well and gives a sense of LFP signal structure, but does not visualize higher-level neural (unit) or behavioral data, thus not capturing the full data structure/complexity as effectively.

<question>8</question>
<question_shortened>Interpretations/conclusions clarity</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook attempts to draw strong scientific conclusions; both focus on demonstration. All interpretations ("Data from...", "Here we show...") are minimal and supported by shown data. Notebook 1 includes descriptive statistics (tables, distributions) which match the code and visualizations. No confusing or unsupported interpretations were noticed in either. Therefore, their clarity is equivalent.

<question>9</question>
<question_shortened>Redundancy/repetitiveness</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Neither notebook suffers from notable redundancy. Each code and plot block in both is directed at a distinct aspect or type of data. If anything, Notebook 2 is somewhat more focused (only one LFP file and channel geometry are shown), but there is no unnecessary repetition in Notebook 1 either, despite the broader scope.

<question_shortened>Guidance on potential next questions/analyses</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 includes a "Next Steps" section listing suggestions—analyzing other probes/channels, more behavioral/neural data, deeper custom analysis, and advises reviewing documentation—providing actionable directions. Notebook 2's "Next Steps" similarly prompts accessing other probes, spike/unit data, and stimulus responses. Both give useful but brief guidance. However, because Notebook 1 engages with more types of data in code, it also implicitly suggests a broader range of next analyses.

<question_shortened>Clarity/Ease of following</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 is well segmented, with headers and short, clear commentary before each cell, describes the goal/purpose of each step, and uses code that closely matches the described text. Notebook 2 is also clear, especially in the metadata and LFP sections, and is a bit more concise/streamlined (fewer data types). For an absolute beginner, Notebook 2's reduced complexity might be easier, but Notebook 1 provides a richer narrative aligned with each block. Overall, both are clear, so differences are minor.

<question_shortened>Reusability/adaptability of code</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 provides diverse, modular code examples that would be easy to repurpose for loading different types of data, different time windows, or expanding to more advanced analyses. Variable names are informative, and steps are generalizable. Notebook 2's code is clear and reusable for probe geometry and LFP plotting, but is more limited in scope, requiring more user initiative to generalize to other datasets or modalities.

<question_shortened>Helpfulness in planning next analyses/questions</question_shortened>
<rationale>
This partially duplicates question 10. Notebook 1, by showing how to load multiple data types, inspires further analysis on those and related modalities. Its "Next Steps" and comprehensive coverage enable the user to envision both straightforward extensions (other probes/sessions) and more advanced analyses (single-unit, behavioral correlations, stimulus-driven patterns). Notebook 2 is narrower, mainly inspiring further LFP/probe-based questions unless the user already knows how to adapt the code to other types.

<question_shortened>Overall helpfulness for getting started</question_shortened>
<rationale>
Notebook 1 is strongly preferable for a user wishing to get an in-depth orientation to this Dandiset. It supports a broader, more practical introduction, touches all major data modalities, gives clear and diverse code/visualization examples, and empowers the user to branch into new analyses. Notebook 2 is helpful for a minimal, focused exploration (especially for LFP/probe geometry), but falls short for users interested in the Dandiset's full scientific breadth.
