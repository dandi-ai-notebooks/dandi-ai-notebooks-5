Based on the above two notebooks and the criteria below, please provide a detailed pairwise comparison to weighs the strengths and weaknesses of each notebook.

Address the following questions, one by one, in your comparison:

1. How well did the notebook help you understand the purpose and content of the Dandiset?
2. After reviewing the notebook, do you feel confident in how to access the different types of data from this Dandiset?
3. Did the notebook help you understand the structure of the NWB file(s) and how to work with them?
4. Did the visualizations in the notebook generally help you understand key aspects of the data?
5. Did any of the visualizations make it harder to understand the data (e.g., due to poor formatting, unclear axes, or misleading displays)?
6. Do you feel more confident creating your own visualizations of the data after seeing the examples in the notebook?
7. How well did the visualizations show the structure or complexity of the data?
8. Were there any interpretations or conclusions in the notebook that felt unclear or not well supported by the data shown?
9. Did any of the plots or examples feel unnecessarily repetitive or redundant?
10. Did the notebook help you understand what kinds of questions or analyses you could do next with this Dandiset?
11. How clear and easy was the notebook to follow?
12. Did the notebook provide code you could easily reuse or adapt to explore the Dandiset yourself?
13. Did the notebook help you understand what kinds of questions or analyses you could do next with this Dandiset?
14. Overall, how helpful was this notebook for getting started with this Dandiset?

For each question, you should respond with an XML block formatted exactly like the following:

<comparison>
<question>n</question>
<question_shortened>Shortened text</question_shortened>

<rationale>
Your notes comparing the two notebooks
</rationale>

<preference>0|1|2</preference>
</comparison>

Here "n" is the number of the question (1-14)
"Shortened text" is a shortened version of the question text, for reference
"Your notes comparing the two notebooks" is your detailed notes comparing the two notebooks for this question.
For preference, you should use 0, 1, or 2, where:
1 means the first notebook is significantly better for this criterion
2 means the second notebook is significantly better for this criterion
0 means the notebooks are about the same for this criterion, with only minor differences.
