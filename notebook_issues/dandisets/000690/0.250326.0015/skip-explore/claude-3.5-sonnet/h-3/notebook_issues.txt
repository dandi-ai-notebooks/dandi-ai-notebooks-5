<description>The LFP traces plot (Anaylzing LFP Data section) likely displays time in units of sample index rather than seconds because lfp.timestamps appears to be very large (values into the hundreds of thousands for "time"), much larger than the expected number of seconds for 10,000 samples at 625 Hz. This makes the X-axis labeling misleading.</description>

<description>The vertical offsets used for plotting LFP traces in the "Analyzing LFP Data" section (i*0.001) are hardcoded and may not be dynamically scaled to the amplitude of the data, potentially leading to overlapping traces or excessive gaps if the signal scale is different across datasets.</description>
