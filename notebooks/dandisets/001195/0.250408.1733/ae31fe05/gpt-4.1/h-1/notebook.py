#
# This Dandiset contains in vivo and ex vivo neuroscience data collected in mice, particularly ex vivo patch-clamp electrophysiology and associated session metadata.  
# The data is organized in Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format and includes current and voltage clamp recordings, as well as detailed stimulus protocols for each cell.
#
# ## What this notebook covers
#
# - Introduction to the Dandiset and overview of data types.
# - How to programmatically list and explore asset (file) names using the DANDI API.
# - How to stream and load NWB files for exploration using `pynwb` and `remfile` (no local downloads needed).
# - How to identify and visualize current clamp and voltage clamp sweepsâ€”both responses and command waveforms.
# - Tips for understanding the organizational structure of the data.
#
# **Note:** This particular NWB file (as in this example) does not contain calcium imaging or behavioral video data. For those modalities, you would need to explore other files in this Dandiset.

# ## Required Packages
#
# To run this notebook, you will need the following packages (assumed to already be installed in your environment):
#
# - `dandi`
# - `pynwb`
# - `remfile`
# - `h5py`
# - `matplotlib`
# - `numpy`
#
# All data access is performed remotely, and NWB files are read via streaming.

# Imports used throughout the notebook

import h5py
import remfile
from dandi.dandiapi import DandiAPIClient

# ## List NWB Files in Dandiset 001195
#
# We'll use the DANDI API to list representative NWB files found in this dandiset.  
# This helps orient you to the available data assets.

# %%
# Use the DANDI API to list several NWB files from this dandiset
dandiset_id = "001195"
dandiset_version = "0.250408.1733"

client = DandiAPIClient()
dandiset = client.get_dandiset(dandiset_id, dandiset_version)

# List the first 10 NWB files as representatives
from itertools import islice

assets = dandiset.get_assets_by_glob("*.nwb")
representative_files = [asset.path for asset in islice(assets, 10)]

print("Representative NWB files in this Dandiset:")
for path in representative_files:
    print("-", path)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Select an Example NWB File
#
# For the demonstrations below, we'll use the following NWB file, which contains ex vivo patch-clamp electrophysiology from a single cell:
#
# ```
# sub-23/sub-23_ses-20150324T134114_slice-slice-1_cell-C1_icephys.nwb
# ```
# We'll load this file directly from the DANDI archive using remote streaming.

# %%
# Set file path and Dandiset information
asset_path = "sub-23/sub-23_ses-20150324T134114_slice-slice-1_cell-C1_icephys.nwb"

# Find and get this asset's download URL
asset = next(dandiset.get_assets_by_glob(asset_path))
download_url = asset.download_url
print("Download URL retrieved for NWB file.")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Inspect Available Data Modalities: Acquisition and Stimulus Series
#
# Each NWB file contains sweeps/epochs for one or more modalities.
# Here we list all acquisition series (response recordings) and stimulus series (command protocols) in our example file.

# %%
# Stream-load the NWB file from remote
remote_file = remfile.File(download_url)
h5_file = h5py.File(remote_file)
io = pynwb.NWBHDF5IO(file=h5_file, load_namespaces=True)

# List all acquisition and stimulus series
acq_list = list(nwbfile.acquisition.keys())

print("Acquisition series:")
for name in acq_list:
    print("-", name)

print("\nStimulus series:")

# ## Visualize a Current Clamp Sweep
#
# Next, we'll select a current clamp response ("current_clamp-response-01-ch-0") and the corresponding stimulus ("stimulus-01-ch-0").
# We'll plot the full voltage response aligned with the current command protocol.

# %%
# Load and plot full trace for a current clamp sweep and its stimulus

# ## Visualize a Voltage Clamp Sweep
#
# We'll now plot one voltage clamp response ("voltage_clamp-response-22-ch-0") and its associated command waveform ("stimulus-22-ch-0").
# This allows inspection of the injected voltage protocol and the cell's membrane current response.

# %%
# Load and plot full trace for a voltage clamp sweep and its stimulus
# Note: The command may be nearly zero for this protocol!
vcrep = nwbfile.acquisition["voltage_clamp-response-22-ch-0"]

# ## Summary of Voltage Clamp Stimulus Protocols
#
# Let's print out the descriptive annotations for all stimulus series (command waveforms), which helps identify files with particular protocols of interest.

# %%
# List all stimulus descriptions for voltage clamp protocols
print("Voltage clamp stimulus series and their descriptions:")
for k in stim_list:
    desc = nwbfile.stimulus[k].description
    print(f"{k}: {desc}")

# ## Notes on Other Data Modalities
#
# This particular NWB file does **not** contain calcium imaging data or behavioral videos.
# If you wish to explore those modalities, look for files in this dandiset possessing NWB entries related to imaging (such as `OnePhotonSeries`, or with "ophys" in the filename) or behavioral series.
#
# The approach and code structure shown here can be adapted to those data types.
