# 
# ## Overview
# 
# This notebook introduces [Dandiset 001354](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/001354/0.250312.0036), which contains single-cell current clamp recordings from mouse hippocampal CA1 neurons. These cells were studied using programmable antigen-gated G-protein-coupled engineered receptors (PAGERs). The dataset consists of NWB files recording responses to injected current steps and ramps, providing a valuable resource for reanalysis and exploration.

# ## 1. Listing Assets and NWB Files in the Dandiset
# 
# Here, we use the DANDI API to list a few example NWB files in the dandiset. Each file represents data from a single recorded cell.

# %%
from dandi.dandiapi import DandiAPIClient
from itertools import islice

DANDISET_ID = "001354"
DANDISET_VERSION = "0.250312.0036"

# Create DANDI API client and get dandiset
client = DandiAPIClient()
dandiset = client.get_dandiset(DANDISET_ID, DANDISET_VERSION)

# List first 10 NWB file assets
nwb_asset_paths = []
assets = dandiset.get_assets_by_glob("*.nwb")
for asset in islice(assets, 10):
    nwb_asset_paths.append(asset.path)

print("Example NWB files in dandiset:")
for path in nwb_asset_paths:
    print("  ", path)

# %% [markdown]
# ## 2. Loading and Exploring a Single NWB File
# 
# Next, we select a representative NWB file for in-depth exploration. NWB files follow a standard data structure, making it easier to find and visualize both electrophysiology data and metadata.
# 
# This example uses remote streaming (no download necessary) via `remfile`.

# %%
import h5py
import pynwb
import remfile

# Choose an NWB file to explore
example_nwb_path = nwb_asset_paths[0]

# Get asset download URL from DANDI
asset = next(dandiset.get_assets_by_glob(example_nwb_path))
remote_file = remfile.File(asset.download_url)
h5_file = h5py.File(remote_file)

# Open the NWB file using pynwb
io = pynwb.NWBHDF5IO(file=h5_file, load_namespaces=True)
nwbfile = io.read()

print("NWB identifier:", nwbfile.identifier)
print("Session description:", nwbfile.session_description)
print("Session start time:", nwbfile.session_start_time)
print("Subject:", vars(nwbfile.subject))

# ### 2.1. NWB Data Structure: Acquisition and Stimulus Groups
# 
# - The **acquisition** group holds the raw voltage responses (CurrentClampSeries)
# - The **stimulus** group holds the injected current protocols (CurrentClampStimulusSeries)
# 
# Let's preview the names and descriptions for the first few sweeps in each group.

# %%
# List first 5 CurrentClampSeries in acquisition
ccs_list = [(k, v.description) for k, v in islice(nwbfile.acquisition.items(), 5) if v.neurodata_type == 'CurrentClampSeries']
print("First 5 CurrentClampSeries in acquisition:")
for k, desc in ccs_list:
    print(f"  {k}: {desc}")

# List first 5 CurrentClampStimulusSeries in stimulus
ccss_list = [(k, v.description) for k, v in islice(nwbfile.stimulus.items(), 5) if v.neurodata_type == 'CurrentClampStimulusSeries']
print("\nFirst 5 CurrentClampStimulusSeries in stimulus:")
for k, desc in ccss_list:
    print(f"  {k}: {desc}")

# %% [markdown]
# ## 3. Visualizing Raw Voltage and Injected Current
# 
# We now load and plot the voltage and injected current traces for a single sweep, using:
# - The **CurrentClampSeries** corresponding to `'current_clamp-response-01-ch-0'`
# - The **CurrentClampStimulusSeries** corresponding to `'stimulus-01-ch-0'`
# 
# We overlay them to visualize the direct relationship between injected current and the neuron's voltage response. Conversion factors in NWB are carefully applied for correct physical units.

# %%
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load sweep traces
ccs = nwbfile.acquisition['current_clamp-response-01-ch-0']
ccss = nwbfile.stimulus['stimulus-01-ch-0']

# Voltage in volts (conversion factor applied)
voltage = ccs.data[:] * ccs.conversion
sampling_rate = ccs.rate  # Hz
time = np.arange(len(voltage)) / sampling_rate

# Current in nA (apply .data, .conversion, and 1e9 scale)
current_nA = ccss.data[:] * ccss.conversion * 1e9
current_time = np.arange(len(current_nA)) / ccss.rate

# Plot overlay with twin axes (best for comparing traces)
fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 4))
color1 = 'tab:blue'
color2 = 'tab:orange'
ax1.plot(time, voltage, color=color1, label='Voltage (V)')
ax1.set_ylabel('Voltage (V)', color=color1)
ax1.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor=color1)

ax2 = ax1.twinx()
ax2.plot(current_time, current_nA, color=color2, label='Current (nA)', alpha=0.6)
ax2.set_ylabel('Injected Current (nA)', color=color2)
ax2.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor=color2)

plt.title('Voltage and Injected Current for Sweep 01 (proper scaling)')
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# %% [markdown]
# **Interpretation:**  
# The plot above displays the voltage (blue, left axis) and injected current (orange, right axis, in nA) for a single sweep. Note how the neuron fires action potentials during the ramp phase of the stimulus, after several subthreshold or step-form tests.
# 
# This illustrates how to directly relate stimulus protocol to electrophysiological response.

# %% [markdown]
# ## 4. Accessing and Exploring Sweep Metadata
# 
# Beyond the raw time series, detailed metadata tables in the NWB file annotate each sweepâ€”such as protocol type, sweep grouping, and links between stimulus and response.
# 
# The `intracellular_recordings` table connects each voltage trace (response) with the corresponding current injection (stimulus), electrode, and sweep indices. The `icephys_sequential_recordings` table provides protocol-level grouping and annotations such as stimulus type.
# 
# Example: Previewing stimulus/response pairings and stimulus type.

# %%
# Convert intracellular_recordings table to a dataframe and show first 5 rows
df = nwbfile.intracellular_recordings.to_dataframe()
print("Columns in intracellular_recordings table:", df.columns.tolist())
print("\nFirst 5 rows:")
print(df.head())

# Preview protocol annotation from sequential recordings table
df_seq = nwbfile.icephys_sequential_recordings.to_dataframe()
print("\nSequential recordings protocol grouping (first 5 rows):")
print(df_seq[['stimulus_type']].head())

# %% [markdown]
# **Interpretation:**  
# - The `intracellular_recordings` table gives sweep-by-sweep pairing of data and protocol, referencing each relevant acquisition and stimulus object.
# - The `stimulus_type` column in the sequential recordings table tells us that the current protocol used for this block of sweeps is a "ramp".
# 
# This metadata lays the groundwork for systematic, scalable re-analysis of stimulus-evoked neuronal responses.

# ## 5. Summary and Next Steps
# 
# This notebook has demonstrated:
# - How to find and list NWB files in Dandiset 001354
# - How to stream, inspect, and visualize voltage and current data for a representative sweep
# - How to access sweep- and protocol-level metadata for systematic analysis
# 
# **What next?**
# - Loop over files, cells, or sweeps to compare responses across conditions or genotypes
# - Quantify action potential output, input resistance, or other physiological properties
# - Leverage metadata tables for grouping, filtering, or linking related sweeps
