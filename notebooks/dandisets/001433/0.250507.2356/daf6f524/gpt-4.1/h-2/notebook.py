#
# ## Overview
#
# [Dandiset 001433](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/001433/0.250507.2356) contains behavioral and electrophysiological data from freely moving mice. The dataset includes:
#
# - Simultaneous local field potential (LFP) recordings from the olfactory bulb (16 electrodes)
# - Sniffing/respiration voltage signal (single channel, via thermistor)
# - Processed behavioral events: inhalation and exhalation times
#
# No experimental task, reward, or imposed stimulus is presentâ€”mice were recorded during natural behavior.
#
# The files are stored in NWB format and each session typically includes:
# - Raw LFP
# - Sniff signal
# - Behavioral event times (inhalation/exhalation)
# - Complete subject and recording metadata
#
# For more details, see the [DANDI repository](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/001433/0.250507.2356).

# ## 1. DANDI API: Browsing NWB files in the Dandiset
#
# We start by listing a few NWB files available in this Dandiset using the DANDI API.
# This step demonstrates how to programmatically access metadata and file listings.

# %%
from dandi.dandiapi import DandiAPIClient
from itertools import islice

# Specify Dandiset ID and version
dandiset_id = "001433"
dandiset_version = "0.250507.2356"

# Initialize DANDI client and fetch the Dandiset
client = DandiAPIClient()
dandiset = client.get_dandiset(dandiset_id, dandiset_version)

# List the first 10 NWB files by their asset path
nwb_assets = dandiset.get_assets_by_glob("*.nwb")
nwb_files = [asset.path for asset in islice(nwb_assets, 10)]

print("Example NWB files in this Dandiset:")
for fname in nwb_files:
    print("-", fname)

# %% [markdown]
# ## 2. Loading and Exploring a Session NWB File
#
# In the following sections, we focus on a representative recording session:
#
# **sub-4122/sub-4122_ses-20250507T152927_ecephys.nwb**
#
# We will extract:
# - LFP time series (all 16 channels)
# - Sniffing (thermistor) signal
# - Inhalation and exhalation event times (behavior module)
#
# Data will be streamed remotely using `remfile` rather than downloaded.

# %%
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pynwb
import h5py
import remfile

# Always close files after use in a real workflow.
# Here we open the file for demonstration and exploration.

nwb_path = "sub-4122/sub-4122_ses-20250507T152927_ecephys.nwb"

# Find the download URL for remote streaming
asset = next(dandiset.get_assets_by_glob(nwb_path))
url = asset.download_url

# Open NWB file remotely via remfile and h5py
remote_file = remfile.File(url)
h5_file = h5py.File(remote_file, 'r')
io = pynwb.NWBHDF5IO(file=h5_file, load_namespaces=True)
nwb = io.read()

print("Loaded NWB file:", nwb_path)
print("Session description:", nwb.session_description)
print("Subject ID:", nwb.subject.subject_id)
print("Session start time:", nwb.session_start_time)

# ### Quick Summary of File Structure
# * LFP: 16-channel signal, olfactory bulb, 1000 Hz sampling
# * SniffSignal: single-channel, thermistor voltage, 1000 Hz sampling
# * Behavioral module: inhalation/exhalation event times (in milliseconds, convert to seconds)
# * All metadata is in standard NWB tables

# ## 3. LFP and Sniff Signal: First 10 Seconds Visualization
#
# Let's extract the first 10 seconds from both the LFP (channel 0 for clarity) and sniffing trace, and visualize them.

# %%
# Parameters
duration_sec = 10

# -- LFP signal --
lfp = nwb.acquisition['LFP']
sample_rate = int(lfp.rate)  # expected 1000 Hz
n_samples = duration_sec * sample_rate

lfp_data = lfp.data[:n_samples, :]      # shape: (samples, channels)
lfp_time = np.arange(n_samples) / sample_rate

# -- Sniff signal --
sniff = nwb.acquisition['SniffSignal']
sniff_data = sniff.data[:n_samples]     # shape: (samples,)
sniff_time = np.arange(n_samples) / sample_rate

# Plot: LFP channel 0 and sniff trace
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)
plt.plot(lfp_time, lfp_data[:, 0], lw=0.8)
plt.title('LFP Channel 0 (Olfactory Bulb) - First 10s')
plt.ylabel('Voltage (V)')
plt.xlim([0, duration_sec])

plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)
plt.plot(sniff_time, sniff_data, color='purple', lw=0.8)
plt.title('Sniff Thermistor Signal - First 10s')
plt.ylabel('Voltage (V)')
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.xlim([0, duration_sec])

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# ## 4. Inhalation and Exhalation Timing Events
#
# The behavioral processing module contains event times for inhalation and exhalation.
# These are stored as NWB TimeSeries objects, with event times in milliseconds (ms).
#
# We'll convert them to seconds and overlay them on the sniff trace for the first 10 seconds.

# %%
# Access behavior processing module and event time series
behavior_mod = nwb.processing['behavior']
inhalation = behavior_mod.data_interfaces['inhalation_time']
exhalation = behavior_mod.data_interfaces['exhalation_time']

# Convert inhalation/exhalation event times from ms to seconds
inhalation_times_sec = inhalation.timestamps[:] / 1000.0
exhalation_times_sec = exhalation.timestamps[:] / 1000.0

# Retain events within the first 10 seconds
inhale_times_plot = inhalation_times_sec[inhalation_times_sec <= duration_sec]
exhale_times_plot = exhalation_times_sec[exhalation_times_sec <= duration_sec]

# Plot sniff trace with overlaid inhalation (blue dashed) and exhalation (red dotted) events
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))
plt.plot(sniff_time, sniff_data, color='purple', lw=0.8, label='Sniff signal')
for idx, t in enumerate(inhale_times_plot):
    plt.axvline(x=t, color='b', alpha=0.7, linestyle='--', label='Inhalation' if idx == 0 else "")
for idx, t in enumerate(exhale_times_plot):
    plt.axvline(x=t, color='r', alpha=0.7, linestyle=':', label='Exhalation' if idx == 0 else "")

plt.title('Sniff Thermistor Signal with Inhalation & Exhalation Events (First 10s)')
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('Voltage (V)')
plt.xlim([0, duration_sec])
plt.legend(loc='upper right')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# ## 5. Other Data and Metadata in the NWB File
#
# - **No spike-sorting results or units table** are included in this file.
# - **No additional behavioral modules** beyond the `behavior` module for breathing event times.
# - **Acquisition** is limited to LFP and sniffing signals.
# - **Device, electrode, and electrode group tables** provide standard metadata (OpenEphys system, 16 LFP electrodes in olfactory bulb).
# - **Subject and session metadata** (subject ID: 4122, sex: M, age: P90D, species: Mus musculus) are standard and included.
# - **No video data or external experimental annotations** are included.
#
# This structure is typical for all files in this Dandiset.

# ## Summary
#
# This notebook demonstrated:
# - How to use the DANDI API to explore available NWB files remotely
# - How to access and visualize LFP, sniffing, and behavioral breathing events through streaming
# - The metadata concept and overall organizational structure for Dandiset 001433
#
# **You are now ready to adapt this workflow to other sessions, channels, or types of analysis!**  
#
# For further exploration, consider:
# - Analyzing LFP across all 16 channels
# - Investigating timing relationships between LFP oscillations and the respiration cycle
# - Detecting and analyzing specific behaviors, or extracting epochs of interest from the sniffing/LFP signals
